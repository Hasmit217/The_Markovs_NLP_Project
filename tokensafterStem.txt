ask

the
follow
question
you
are
given
a
problem
for
which
you
have
to
build
a
softwar
system
that
most
student
feel
will
be
approxim
10,000
line
of
say
c

java

if
you
are
work
full
time
on
it
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
build
thi
system
the
answer
of
student
is
gener
and
given
the
program-
ming
expertis
of
the
student
there
is
a
good
chanc
that
they
will
be
abl
to
build
the
softwar
and
demo
it
to
the
professor
within
with
the
product
of
the
student
will
be
5000
line
of
code
loc
per
person-month
now
let
u
take
an
altern
scenario—w
act
a
client
and
pose
the
same
problem
to
a
compani
that
is
in
the
busi
of
develop
softwar
for
client
though
there
is
no
standard
product
figur
and
it
vari
a
lot
it
is
fair
to
say
a
product
figur
of
1000
loc
per
person-month
is
quit
respect
though
it
can
be
a
low
a
100
loc
per
person-month
for
embed
system
with
thi
product
a
team
of
profession
in

organ
will
take
10

for

in
the

there
are
three
basic
forc
at

qualiti
the

should
be

it

which
we

instead

the

in

plain
http
is

in
thi
one
a
cooki
are
also
need
the

so
if
the

disabl
cooki
the
requir

and
thi

now
suppos
we
want
the

to
be
extend

it
wa
found
that
the
databas
server
is
somewhat

is
frequent
down
it
wa
also
felt
that
when
the

given
the

when
he
submit
the

a

a

we
assum
that
the

can
be
outdat
by
about
even
if
it
doe
not
includ

is
ok
what
the
dean
want
wa
to
make
the
system
more
reliabl
and
provid
some
facil
for
complet
the
survey
even
when
the
databas
is
down
to
make
the
system
more
reliabl
the
follow
strategi
wa

when
the

submit
the

the

interact
with
the

a
befor
the

if
the

unavail
the

data
is
store

thi
can
be
done
for
up
to

the

so
much
that
it
is

can

with

here
we
provid

structur

is
a
program
ha
a
static
structur
a
well
a
a
dynam

the
static
structur
is
the
structur
of
the

of
the

which
is
just
a
linear
orga-

of
statement
of
the

the
dynam
structur
of
the

is
the
sequenc
of
statement
execut
dure
the
execut
of
the
program
in
other
word
both
the
static
structur
and
the
dynam
behavior
are
sequenc
of
statement
while
the
sequenc
repres
the
static
structur
of
a

is
fix
the
sequenc
of
statement
it
execut
can
chang
from
execut
to
execut
it
will
clearli
be
easier
to
understand
the
dynam

if
the
structur
in
the

resembl
the
static
structur
the
closer
the
corre-

between
execut
and

structur
the
easier
the
program
is
to
understand
and
the
more
differ
the
structur
dure
execut
the
harder
it
will
be
to
argu
about
the
behavior
from
the

text
the
goal
of
structur
program
is
to
ensur
that
the
static

the

are
the

that
is
the

that
the

the

of
a

is
the

note
that

so
if
we

thi
we
need
to
construct
the

a

assign
statement
it
is
a

the
key
properti
of
a
structur

is
that
it
ha
a
single-entri

a

we
can
view

if

basic

conceiv

modern
languag
have
other
such
construct
that
help
linear
the
control

of
a

which
gener
speak
make
it
easier
to

so
that

are
use
the
basic
goal
a
we
have
tri
to
emphas
is
to
make
the
logic
of
the

simpl
to

no

for

a

note
about
the
structur
construct
ani
piec
of

with
a

ap-

a
a

in
the
worst
case
the
whole
program
could
be
defin
to
be
a

the
basic
object
of
use
structur
construct
is
to
linear
the
control
flow
so
that
the
execut
behavior
is
easier
to
under-
stand
and
argu
about
in
linear
control

if
we
understand
the
behavior
of

of
the
basic
construct
properli
the
behavior
of
the
program
can
be
consid
a
composit
of
the
behavior
of
the
differ
statement
for
thi
approach
to
work
it
is
impli
that
we
can
clearli
understand
and
specifi
the
behavior
of
each

thi
requir
that
we
be

to
succinctli
captur

describ
the

we

thi
it

possibl
to

for
an

we
can
not

thi
mere
becaus
it

a
single-entri

it
is
from
thi
view-
point
that
the
structur
mention
earlier
are
chosen
a
structur

there
are
well-defin

how
these

behav
dure
execut
which
allow
u
to
argu
about
larger
program
overal
it
can
be
said
that
structur
program
lead
to
program
that
are
easier
to
understand
than
unstructur
program
and
that
such
program
are
easier
to
formal
prove
howev
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
structur
program
is
not
an
end
in
itself
our
basic
object
is
that
the
program
be
easi
to
understand
and
structur
program
is
a
safe
approach
for
achiev
thi
object
still
there
are
some
common
program
practic
that
are
now
well
understood
that
make
use
of
unstructur
construct
e.g.
break
statement
continu
statement
although
effort
should
be
made
to
avoid
use
statement
that
effect
violat
the
single-entri
single-exit
properti
if
the
use
of
such
statement
is
the
simplest
way
to
organ
the
program
then
from
the
point
of
view
of
readabl
the
construct
should
be
use
the
main
point
is
that
ani
unstructur
construct
should
be
use
onli
if
the
structur
altern
is
harder
to
understand
thi
view
can
be

a
few
point
are

note
about

the
approach
say
that
you
write

thi
the
code
is
alway
in

thi
is
not
alway
the
case
with
the
code-first
approach
in
which
it
is
all
too
common
to
write
a
long
piec
of
code
but
then
onli
write
a
few
test
which
cover
onli
some
part
of

by
encourag
that

of

is
shift
to
the

the
test
case
that
is
it
is
the
task
of

to

that
the

help
ensur
that

36
a
key
point
here
is
that
the
chang
is
be
made
to
the
design
embodi
in
the
sourc
code
i.e.
the
intern
structur
exclus
for
improv
purpos
the
basic
object
of
refactor
is
to
improv
the
design
howev
note
that
thi
is
not
about
improv
a
design
dure
the
design
stage
for
creat
a
design
which
is
to
be
later
implement
which
is
the
focu
of
design
method-
olog
but
about
improv
the
design
of
code
that
alreadi
exist
in
other
word
refactor
though
done
on
sourc
code
ha
the
object
of
improv
the
design
that
the
code
implement
therefor
the
basic
principl
of
design
guid
the
refactor
process
consequ
a
refactor
gener
result
in
one
or
more
of
the
follow
refactor
involv
chang
the
code
to
improv
one
of
the
design
proper-
tie
while
keep
the
extern
behavior
the
same
refactor
is
often
trigger
by
some
code
chang
that
have
to
be
done
if
some
enhanc
are
to
be
made
to
the
exist
code
and
it
is
felt
that
if
the
code
structur
wa
differ
better
then
the
chang
could
have
been
done
easier
that
is
the
time
to
do
refactor
to
improv
the
code
structur
even
though
refactor
is
trigger
by
the
need
to
chang
the
softwar
and
it
extern
behavior
it
should
not
be
confus
or
mix
with
the
chang
for
enhanc
it
is
best
to
keep
these
two
type
of
chang
separ
so
while
develop
code
if
refactor
is
need
the
programm
should
ceas
to
write
new
function
and
first
do
the
refactor
and
then
add
new
code
the
main
risk
of
refactor
is
that
exist
work
code
may
break
due
to
the
chang
be
made
thi
is
the
main
reason
whi
often
refactor
is
not
done
the
other
reason
is
that
it
may
be
view
a
an

unnecessari

risk
the

here
we
discu
some
approach
for
unit
test
use
test
framework
in
the
previou
chapter
we
have
seen
that
when
use
procedur
unit
for
modul
a
program
can
be
view
a
a
structur
chart
in
which
node
are
function
and
edg
repres
a
call
relationship
in
unit
test
one
or
a
small
collect
of
these
modul
is
to
be
test
with
a
set
of
test
case
as
the
behavior
of
a
modul
depend
on
the
valu
of
it
paramet
a
well
a
the
overal
state
of
the
system
of
which
it
is
a
part
e.g.
state
of
global
variabl
a
test
case
for
a
modul
f
will
involv
set
both
the
state
of
the
system
on
which
the
behavior
of
f
depend
a
well
a
the
valu
of
paramet
the
actual
valu
and
the
state
of
the
system
for
a
test
case
depend
on
the
purpos
for
which
the
tester
ha
design
thi
test
case
in
addit
if
a
modul
f
ha
other
modul
below
it
in
the
structur
chart
that
is
the
modul
call
other
modul
say
g
and
h
then
for
execut
f
we
must
have
code
for
g
and
h
also
avail
thi
is
handl
in
two
way
first
is
to
test
in
a
bottom-up
manner
i.e.
test
the
modul
at
the
bottom
of
the
structur
chart
first
and
then
move
up
in
thi
approach
when
test
f
the
test
code
for
g
and
h
will
be
avail
and
will
be
use
dure
test
the
other
approach
is
to
write
stub
for
g
and
h
stub
are
throwaway
code
written
for
the
call
function
onli
to
facilit
test
of
the
caller
function
often
the
stub
for
a
function
will
just
print
some
statement
if
no
valu
is
to
be
return
if
some
valu
is
to
be
return
for
the
caller
to
proceed
then
often
a
few
valu
will
be
hard
code
in
the
stub
and
then
the
caller
will
ensur
that
the
stub
is
call
with
the
valu
for
which
it
ha
been
code
we
will
assum
that
the
former
approach
is
be
follow
that
is
for
test
f
test
code
for
g
and
h
is
alreadi
avail
test
of
a
modul
f
by
a
test
case
will
then
involv
the
follow
step
declar
whether
the
test
case
ha
succeed
or
fail
the
simplest
and
commonli
use
approach
for
execut
thi
sequenc
of
step
is
to
write
a
main
program
which
execut
the
first
three
step
with
the
valu
be
given
a
input
by
the
tester
or
read
from
a
file
or
hard
code
in
the
program
and
then
print
out
the
import
valu
the
programm
then
execut
the
last
two
step
name
compar
the
result
with
expect
and
decid
whether
the
test
ha
succeed
or
fail
due
to
the
need
of
programm
intervent
for
evalu
the
output
and
possibl
also
for
give
input
thi
approach
is
not
easi
to
scale
onc
a
test
case
is
design
thi
sequenc
of
step
remain
fix
and
henc
is
ideal
for
complet
autom
in
a
test
framework
often
a
test
case
will
be
declar
a
a
function
in
which
thi
sequenc
of
step
is
execut
for
that
test
case
includ
the
check
of
the
outcom
and
declar
the
result—thi
be
done
often
with
the
help
of
assert
statement
provid
by
the
framework
a
test
suit
is
then
a
collect
of
these
function
and
execut
of
a
test
suit
mean
each
of
the
function
is
execut
the
test
suit
succe
if
all
the
test
case
succeed
if
a
test
case
fail
then
the
test
framework
will
decid
whether
to
continu
execut
or
stop
a
function
for
a
test
case
can
be
easili
defined—it
will
execut
the
sequenc
of
step
given
abov
howev
execut
the
modul
under
test
with
the
test
case
is
not
straightforward
a
a
suitabl
execut
will
have
to
be
form
which
can
execut
the

repres
the
test

and
report
the
result
about

without

the

a

is
to
detect
the

the

find

thi
emphasi
on
proper
intent
of

is
not

becaus
test

human
be
have
a

the

they
have
in

so
if
the

is
to

we
may
conscious

select

and
that
will
beat
the

on
the
other
hand
if
the
intent
is
to
show
that
the
program
doe
not
work
we
will
challeng
our
intellect
to
find
test

toward
that
end
and
we
are
like
to
detect
more
error
test
is
essenti
a

the

of

the

natur

to

test
the

howev
without

an

the
rational
of

thi

the
assumpt

the
other
consist

for
robust
softwar
we

if
the

then
we
should
