An
introductory
course
on
Software
Engineering
remains
one
of
the
hardest
subjects
to
teach
largely
because
of
the
wide
range
of
topics
the
area
encom-
passes
.
I
have
believed
for
some
time
that
we
often
tend
to
teach
too
many
concepts
and
topics
in
an
introductory
course
resulting
in
shallow
knowledge
and
little
insight
on
application
of
these
concepts
.
And
Software
Engineering
is
finally
about
application
of
concepts
to
efficiently
engineer
good
software
solutions
.
I
believe
that
an
introductory
course
on
Software
Engineering
should
focus
on
imparting
to
students
the
knowledge
and
skills
that
are
needed
to
successfully
execute
a
commercial
project
of
a
few
person-months
effort
while
employing
proper
practices
and
techniques
.
It
is
worth
pointing
out
that
a
vast
majority
of
the
projects
executed
in
the
industry
today
fall
in
this
scope—executed
by
a
small
team
over
a
few
months
.
I
also
believe
that
by
carefully
selecting
the
concepts
and
topics
,
we
can
,
in
the
course
of
a
semester
,
achieve
this
.
This
is
the
motivation
of
this
book
.
The
goal
of
this
book
is
to
introduce
to
the
students
a
limited
number
of
concepts
and
practices
which
will
achieve
the
following
two
objectives
:
Teach
the
student
the
skills
needed
to
execute
a
smallish
commercial
project
.
Provide
the
students
necessary
conceptual
background
for
undertaking
ad-
vanced
studies
in
software
engineering
,
through
courses
or
on
their
own
.
I
have
included
in
this
book
only
those
concepts
that
I
believe
are
founda-
tional
and
through
which
the
two
objectives
mentioned
above
can
be
met
.
Ad-
vanced
topics
have
been
consciously
left
out
.
As
executing
a
software
project
requires
skills
in
two
dimensions—engineering
and
project
management—this
book
focuses
on
key
tasks
in
these
two
dimensions
,
and
discusses
concepts
and
techniques
that
can
be
applied
to
effectively
execute
these
tasks
.
The
book
is
organized
in
a
simple
manner
,
with
one
chapter
for
each
of
the
key
tasks
in
a
project
.
For
engineering
,
these
tasks
are
requirements
analy-
sis
and
specification
,
architecture
design
,
module
level
design
,
coding
and
unit
testing
,
and
testing
.
For
project
management
,
the
key
tasks
are
project
plan-
ning
and
project
monitoring
and
control
,
but
both
are
discussed
together
in
one
chapter
on
project
planning
as
even
monitoring
has
to
be
planned
.
In
addi-
tion
,
the
book
contains
one
chapter
that
clearly
defines
the
problem
domain
of
Software
Engineering
,
and
another
chapter
that
discusses
the
central
concept
of
software
process
which
integrates
the
different
tasks
executed
in
a
project
.
Each
chapter
opens
with
some
introduction
and
then
clearly
lists
the
chapter
goals
,
or
what
the
reader
can
expect
to
learn
from
the
chapter
.
For
the
task
covered
in
the
chapter
,
the
important
concepts
are
first
discussed
,
followed
by
a
discussion
of
the
output
of
the
task
,
the
desired
quality
properties
of
the
output
,
and
some
practical
methods
and
notations
for
performing
the
task
.
The
explanations
are
supported
by
examples
,
and
the
key
learnings
are
summarized
in
the
end
for
the
reader
.
The
chapter
ends
with
some
self-assessment
exercises
.
The
book
is
primarily
intented
for
an
introductory
course
on
Software
Engi-
neering
in
any
undergraduate
or
graduate
program
.
It
is
targeted
for
students
who
know
programming
but
have
not
had
a
formal
exposure
to
software
engi-
neering
.
The
book
can
also
be
used
by
professionals
who
are
in
a
similar
state—know
some
programming
but
want
to
be
introduced
to
the
systematic
approach
of
software
engineering
.
Though
the
book
is
self-contained
,
some
teaching
support
and
supplemental
resources
are
available
through
a
website
.
The
URL
is
:
The
resources
available
on
the
site
include
:
The
powerpoint
presentations
for
each
chapter

their
style
.
Various
templates
for
different
outputs
in
a

project
in
the
course

Some
practice

unit
testing
and
inspections
.
I
would
like
to
express
my
gratitude
to
my
editor
,
Wayne
Wheeler
,
who
con-
ceived
this
idea
of
a
concise
introductory
book
and
created
this
opportunity
.
I
would
also
like
to
express
my
thanks
to
my
wife
,
Shikha
,
and
my
daughters
Sumedha
and
Sunanda
for
once
again
bearing
with
my
moods
and
odd
hours
.
Ask
any
student
who
has
had
some
programming
experience
the
following
question
:
You
are
given
a
problem
for
which
you
have
to
build
a
software
system
that
most
students
feel
will
be
approximately
10,000
lines
of
(
say
C
or
Java
)
code
.
If
you
are
working
full
time
on
it
,
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
build
this
system
?
The
answer
of
students
is
generally
.
And
,
given
the
program-
ming
expertise
of
the
students
,
there
is
a
good
chance
that
they
will
be
able
to
build
the
software
and
demo
it
to
the
professor
within
.
With
,
the
productivity
of
the
student
will
be
5000
lines
of
code
(
LOC
)
per
person-month
.
Now
let
us
take
an
alternative
scenario—we
act
as
clients
and
pose
the
same
problem
to
a
company
that
is
in
the
business
of
developing
software
for
clients
.
Though
there
is
no
standard
productivity
figure
and
it
varies
a
lot
,
it
is
fair
to
say
a
productivity
figure
of
1000
LOC
per
person-month
is
quite
respectable
(
though
it
can
be
as
low
as
100
LOC
per
person-month
for
embedded
systems
)
.
With
this
productivity
,
a
team
of
professionals
in
a
software
organization
will
take
10
person-months
to
build
this
software
system
.
Why
this
difference
in
productivity
in
the
two
scenarios
?
Why
is
it
that
the
same
students
who
can
produce
software
at
a
productivity
of
a
few
thousand
LOC
per
month
while
in
college
end
up
producing
only
about
a
thousand
LOC
per
month
when
working
in
a
company
?
The
answer
,
of
course
,
is
that
two
different
things
are
being
built
in
the
two
scenarios
.
In
the
first
,
a
student
system
is
being
built
which
is
primarily
meant
for
demonstration
purposes
,
and
is
not
expected
to
be
used
later
.
Because
it
is
P.
Jalote
,
A
Concise
Introduction
to
Software
Engineering
,
not
to
be
used
,
nothing
of
significance
depends
on
the
software
and
the
presence
of
bugs
and
lack
of
quality
is
not
a
major
concern
.
Neither
are
the
other
quality
issues
like
usability
,
maintainability
,
portability
etc
.
On
the
other
hand
,
an
industrial-strength
software
system
is
built
to
solve
some
problem
of
a
client
and
is
used
by
the
client
’
s
organization
for
operating
some
part
of
business
,
and
a
malfunction
of
such
a
system
can
have
huge
impact
in
terms
of
financial
or
business
loss
,
inconvenience
to
users
,
or
loss
of
property
and
life
.
Consequently
,
the
software
system
needs
to
be
of
high
quality
with
respect
to
properties
like
reliability
,
usability
,
portability
,
etc
.
This
need
for
high
quality
and
to
satisfy
the
the
end
users
has
a
major
impact
on
the
way
software
is
developed
and
its
cost
.
The
rule
of
thumb
Brooks
gives
suggests
that
the
industrial-strength
software
may
cost
about
10
times
the
student
software
[
16
]
.
The
software
industry
is
largely
interested
in
developing
industrial-strength
software
,
and
the
area
of
software
engineering
focuses
on
how
to
build
such
systems
.
That
is
,
the
problem
domain
for
software
engineering
is
industrial-
strength
software
.
In
the
rest
of
the
book
,
when
we
use
the
term
software
,
we
mean
industrial-strength
software
.
In
the
remainder
of
this
chapter
,
we
will
learn
That
quality
,
cost
,
and
schedule
are
the
main
forces
that
drive
a
(
industrial-
strength
)
software
project
.
How
cost
and
productivity
are
defined
and
measured
for
such
a
project
,
and
how
quality
of
software
is
characterized
and
measured
.
That
large
scale
and
change
are
important
attributes
of
the
problem
domain
and
solution
approaches
have
to
handle
them
.
Though
the
need
for
high
quality
distinguishes
industrial
strength
software
from
others
,
cost
and
schedule
are
other
major
driving
forces
for
such
software
.
In
the
industrial-strength
software
domain
,
there
are
three
basic
forces
at
play—cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
.
The
software
should
be
produced
at
reasonable
cost
,
in
a
reasonable
time
,
and
should
be
of
good
quality
.
These
three
parameters
often
drive
and
define
a
software
project
.
Industrial-strength
software
is
very
expensive
primarily
due
to
the
fact
that
software
development
is
extremely
labor-intensive
.
To
get
an
idea
of
the
costs
involved
,
let
us
consider
the
current
state
of
practice
in
the
industry
.
Lines
of
code
(
LOC
)
or
thousands
of
lines
of
code
(
KLOC
)
delivered
is
by
far
the
most
commonly
used
measure
of
software
size
in
the
industry
.
As
the
main
cost
of
producing
software
is
the
manpower
employed
,
the
cost
of
developing
software
is
generally
measured
in
terms
of
person-months
of
effort
spent
in
development
.
And
productivity
is
frequently
measured
in
the
industry
in
terms
of
LOC
(
or
KLOC
)
per
person-month
.
The
productivity
in
the
software
industry
for
writing
fresh
code
generally
ranges
from
few
hundred
to
about
1000+
LOC
per
person-month
.
This
produc-
tivity
is
over
the
entire
development
cycle
,
not
just
the
coding
task
.
Software
companies
often
charge
the
client
for
whom
they
are
developing
the
software
be-
tween
$
3000
-
$
15,000
per
person-month
.
With
a
productivity
of
1000
LOC
per
person-month
,
it
means
that
each
line
of
delivered
code
costs
between
$
$
15
!
And
even
small
projects
can
easily
end
up
with
software
of
50,000
LOC
.
With
this
productivity
,
such
a
software
project
will
cost
between
$
150,000
and
Schedule
is
another
important
factor
in
many
projects
.
Business
trends
are
dictating
that
the
time
to
market
of
a
product
should
be
reduced
;
that
is
,
the
cycle
time
from
concept
to
delivery
should
be
small
.
For
software
this
means
that
it
needs
to
be
developed
faster
,
and
within
the
specified
time
.
Unfortunately
,
the
history
of
software
is
full
of
cases
where
projects
have
been
substantially
late
.
Clearly
,
therefore
,
reducing
the
cost
and
the
cycle
time
for
software
de-
velopment
are
central
goals
of
software
engineering
.
Productivity
in
terms
of
output
(
KLOC
)
per
person-month
can
adequately
capture
both
cost
and
sched-
ule
concerns
.
If
productivity
is
higher
,
it
should
be
clear
that
the
cost
in
terms
of
person-months
will
be
lower
(
the
same
work
can
now
be
done
with
fewer
person-months
)
.
Similarly
,
if
productivity
is
higher
,
the
potential
of
developing
the
software
in
less
time
improves—a
team
of
higher
productivity
will
finish
a
job
in
less
time
than
a
same-size
team
with
lower
productivity
.
(
The
actual
time
the
project
will
take
,
of
course
,
depends
also
on
the
number
of
people
al-
located
to
the
project
.
)
Hence
,
pursuit
of
higher
productivity
is
a
basic
driving
force
behind
software
engineering
and
a
major
reason
for
using
the
different
tools
and
techniques
.
Besides
cost
and
schedule
,
the
other
major
factor
driving
software
engi-
neering
is
quality
.
Today
,
quality
is
one
of
the
main
mantras
,
and
business
strategies
are
designed
around
it
.
Unfortunately
,
a
large
number
of
instances
have
occurred
regarding
the
unreliability
of
software—the
software
often
does
not
do
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
or
does
something
it
is
not
supposed
to
do
.
Clearly
,
developing
high-quality
software
is
another
fundamental
goal
of
soft-
ware
engineering
.
However
,
while
cost
is
generally
well
understood
,
the
concept
of
quality
in
the
context
of
software
needs
further
elaboration
.
The
international
standard
on
software
product
quality
[
55
]
suggests
that
software
quality
comprises
six
main
attributes
,
as
shown
in
Figure
These
attributes
can
be
defined
as
follows
:
Functionality
.
The
capability
to
provide
functions
which
meet
stated
and
implied
needs
when
the
software
is
used
.
Reliability
.
The
capability
to
provide
failure-free
service
.
Usability
.
The
capability
to
be
understood
,
learned
,
and
used
.
Efficiency
.
The
capability
to
provide
appropriate
performance
relative
to
the
amount
of
resources
used
.
Maintainability
.
The
capability
to
be
modified
for
purposes
of
making
cor-
rections
,
improvements
,
or
adaptation
.
Portability
.
The
capability
to
be
adapted
for
different
specified
environ-
ments
without
applying
actions
or
means
other
than
those
provided
for
this
purpose
in
the
product
.
With
multiple
dimensions
to
quality
,
different
projects
may
emphasize
dif-
ferent
attributes
,
and
a
global
single
number
for
quality
is
not
possible
.
How-
ever
,
despite
the
fact
that
there
are
many
quality
attributes
,
reliability
is
gen-
erally
accepted
to
be
the
main
quality
criterion
.
As
unreliability
of
software
is
due
to
the
presence
of
defects
in
the
software
,
one
measure
of
quality
is
the
number
of
defects
in
the
delivered
software
per
unit
size
(
generally
taken
to
be
thousands
of
lines
of
code
,
or
KLOC
)
.
With
this
as
the
major
quality
criterion
,
the
quality
objective
is
to
reduce
the
number
of
defects
per
KLOC
as
much
as
possible
.
Current
best
practices
in
software
engineering
have
been
able
to
reduce
the
defect
density
to
less
than
.
To
determine
the
quality
of
a
software
product
,
we
need
to
determine
the
number
of
defects
in
the
software
that
was
delivered
.
This
number
is
clearly
not
known
at
delivery
time
and
may
never
be
known
.
One
approach
to
measure
quality
is
to
log
the
defects
found
in
(
or
)
after
delivery
and
define
quality
with
respect
to
these
defects
.
This
means
that
quality
of
delivered
software
can
only
be
determined
.
The
defect
density
can
,
however
,
also
be
estimated
from
past
data
of
similar
projects—if
similar
approaches
are
being
used
,
then
it
is
expected
that
the
current
project
will
have
similar
defect
density
as
the
past
projects
.
It
should
be
pointed
out
that
to
use
this
definition
of
quality
,
what
a
defect
is
must
be
clearly
defined
.
A
defect
could
be
some
problem
in
the
software
that
causes
the
software
to
crash
or
a
problem
that
causes
an
output
to
be
not
properly
aligned
or
one
that
misspells
some
word
,
etc
.
The
exact
definition
of
what
is
considered
a
defect
will
clearly
depend
on
the
project
or
the
standards
the
organization
developing
the
project
uses
(
typically
it
is
the
latter
)
.
Besides
reliability
,
another
quality
attribute
of
great
interest
is
maintain-
ability
.
Once
the
software
is
delivered
and
deployed
,
it
enters
the
maintenance
phase
.
Why
is
maintenance
needed
for
software
,
when
software
has
no
physical
components
that
can
degrade
with
age
?
Software
needs
to
be
maintained
be-
cause
of
the
residual
defects
remaining
in
the
system
.
It
is
commonly
believed
that
the
state
of
the
art
today
is
limited
and
developing
software
with
zero
de-
fect
density
is
not
possible
.
These
defects
,
once
discovered
,
need
to
be
removed
,
leading
to
what
is
called
corrective
maintenance
.
Maintenance
is
also
needed
to
change
the
delivered
software
to
satisfy
the
enhanced
needs
of
the
users
and
the
environment
,
leading
to
adaptive
maintenance
.
Over
the
life
of
a
software
system
,
maintenance
cost
can
far
exceed
the
cost
of
original
development
.
The
maintenance-to-development-cost
ratio
has
been
variously
suggested
as
80:20
,
70:30
,
or
60:40
.
Due
to
this
high
cost
,
maintainability
attribute
of
delivered
software
is
of
high
interest—it
is
clearly
desirable
to
have
software
systems
that
are
easier
to
maintain
.
Though
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
are
the
main
driving
forces
for
a
project
in
our
problem
domain
(
of
industry
strength
software
)
,
there
are
some
other
char-
acteristics
of
the
problem
domain
that
also
influence
the
solution
approaches
employed
.
We
focus
on
two
such
characteristics—scale
and
change
.
Most
industrial-strength
software
systems
tend
to
be
large
and
complex
,
requiring
tens
of
thousands
of
lines
of
code
.
Sizes
of
some
of
the
well-known
software
products
are
given
in
Table
As
can
be
expected
,
development
of
a
large
system
requires
a
different
set
of
methods
compared
to
developing
a
small
system
,
as
the
methods
that
are
used
for
developing
small
systems
often
do
not
scale
up
to
large
systems
.
An
example
will
illustrate
this
point
.
Consider
the
problem
of
counting
people
in
a
room
versus
taking
a
census
of
a
country
.
Both
are
essentially
counting
problems
.
But
the
methods
used
for
counting
people
in
a
room
will
just
not
work
when
taking
a
census
.
A
different
set
of
methods
will
have
to
be
used
for
conducting
a
census
,
and
the
census
problem
will
require
considerably
more
management
,
organization
,
and
validation
,
in
addition
to
counting
.
Similarly
,
methods
that
one
can
use
to
develop
programs
of
a
few
hundred
lines
can
not
be
expected
to
work
when
software
of
a
few
hundred
thousand
lines
needs
to
be
developed
.
A
different
set
of
methods
must
be
used
for
developing
large
software
.
Any
software
project
involves
the
use
of
engineering
and
project
manage-
ment
.
In
small
projects
,
informal
methods
for
development
and
management
can
be
used
.
However
,
for
large
projects
,
both
have
to
be
much
more
rigorous
,
as
illustrated
in
Figure
In
other
words
,
to
successfully
execute
a
project
,
a
proper
method
for
engineering
the
system
has
to
be
employed
and
the
project
has
to
be
tightly
managed
to
make
sure
that
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
are
under
control
.
Large
scale
is
a
key
characteristic
of
the
problem
domain
and
the
solution
approaches
should
employ
tools
and
techniques
that
have
the
ability
to
build
large
software
systems
.
Change
is
another
characteristic
of
the
problem
domain
which
the
ap-
proaches
for
development
must
handle
.
As
the
complete
set
of
requirements
for
the
system
is
generally
not
known
(
often
can
not
be
known
at
the
start
of
the
project
)
or
stated
,
as
development
proceeds
and
time
passes
,
additional
requirements
are
identified
,
which
need
to
be
incorporated
in
the
software
be-
ing
developed
.
This
need
for
changes
requires
that
methods
for
development
embrace
change
and
accommodate
it
efficiently
.
Change
requests
can
be
quite
disruptive
to
a
project
,
and
if
not
handled
properly
,
can
consume
up
to
30
to
40
%
of
the
development
cost
[
14
]
.
As
discussed
above
,
software
has
to
be
changed
even
after
it
has
been
de-
ployed
.
Though
traditionally
changes
in
software
during
maintenance
have
been
distinguished
from
changes
that
occur
while
the
development
is
taking
place
,
these
lines
are
blurring
,
as
fundamentally
the
changes
in
both
of
these
scenarios
are
similar—existing
source
code
needs
to
be
changed
due
to
some
changes
in
the
requirements
or
due
to
some
defects
that
need
to
be
removed
.
Overall
,
as
the
world
changes
faster
,
software
has
to
change
faster
,
even
while
under
development
.
Changes
in
requirements
are
therefore
a
characteris-
tic
of
the
problem
domain
.
In
today
’
s
world
,
approaches
that
can
not
accept
and
accommodate
change
are
of
little
use—they
can
solve
only
those
few
problems
that
are
change
resistant
.
The
problem
domain
for
software
engineering
is
industrial-strength
software
.
This
software
is
meant
to
solve
some
problem
of
some
set
of
users
,
and
is
expected
to
be
of
high
quality
.
In
this
problem
domain
,
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
are
basic
driving
forces
.
Hence
,
methods
and
tools
that
will
be
used
for
solving
problems
in
this
domain
must
ensure
high
productivity
and
high
quality
.
Productivity
is
measured
as
amount
of
output
per
unit
of
input
resource
.
In
software
,
output
can
be
measured
in
terms
of
lines
of
code
delivered
,
and
as
human
time
is
the
main
resource
,
input
can
be
measured
as
person-months
.
Productivity
can
therefore
be
measured
as
lines
of
code
delivered
per
person-
month
.
Software
quality
has
many
attributes
which
include
functionality
,
reliabil-
ity
,
usability
,
efficiency
,
maintainability
,
and
portability
.
Reliability
is
often
considered
as
the
main
quality
attribute
,
and
as
unreliability
in
software
is
due
to
defects
in
the
software
,
quality
can
be
characterized
by
number
of
defects
per
thousand
lines
of
code
.
The
problems
in
this
domain
often
tend
to
be
very
large
and
where
the
needs
of
the
customers
change
fast
.
Hence
the
techniques
used
for
developing
industrial-strength
software
should
be
such
that
they
are
capable
of
building
large
software
systems
,
and
have
the
capability
to
handle
changes
.
What
are
the
main
differences
between
a
student
software
and
industrial-strength
software
?
If
developing
a
program
for
solving
a
problem
requires
effort
E
,
it
is
estimated
that
an
industrial-strength
software
for
solving
that
problem
will
require
10E
effort
.
Where
do
you
think
this
extra
effort
cost
is
spent
?
What
measurements
will
you
take
in
a
project
to
measure
the
productivity
,
and
how
will
you
determine
the
productivity
from
these
measures
?
What
are
the
different
attributes
of
software
quality
?
If
for
an
accounting
soft-
ware
we
are
most
interested
in
ensuring
that
the
software
does
not
make
any
computation
mistakes
,
then
which
of
the
quality
attributes
should
we
be
most
concerned
about
?
What
are
some
of
the
project

tasks
that
you
will
do
differently
for
a
large
project
as
compared
to
a
small
project
?
How
will
your
execution
of
these
tasks
change
?
Suppose
changes
are
to
be
made
to
a
software
system
that
is
in
operation
.
Why
will
changes
to
such
a
system
cost
a
lot
more
than
just
making
changes
to
the
source
code
files
?
Now
that
we
have
a
better
understanding
of
the
problem
domain
that
software
engineering
deals
with
,
let
us
orient
our
discussion
to
software
engineering
itself
.
Software
engineering
is
defined
as
the
systematic
approach
to
the
development
,
operation
,
maintenance
,
and
retirement
of
software
[
52
]
.
We
have
seen
that
besides
delivering
software
,
high
quality
,
low
cost
,
and
low
cycle
time
are
also
goals
which
software
engineering
must
achieve
.
In
other
words
,
the
systematic
approach
must
help
achieve
a
high
quality
and
productiv-
ity
(
Q
&
P
)
.
In
software
,
the
three
main
factors
that
influence
Q
&
P
are
people
,
processes
,
and
technology
.
That
is
,
the
final
quality
delivered
and
productivity
achieved
depends
on
the
skills
of
the
people
involved
in
the
software
project
,
the
processes
people
use
to
perform
the
different
tasks
in
the
project
,
and
the
tools
they
use
.
As
it
is
people
who
ultimately
develop
and
deliver
(
and
productivity
is
measured
with
respect
to
people
’
s
effort
as
the
basic
input
)
,
the
main
job
of
processes
is
to
help
people
achieve
higher
Q
&
P
by
specifying
what
tasks
to
do
and
how
to
do
them
.
Tools
are
aids
that
help
people
perform
some
of
the
tasks
more
efficiently
and
with
fewer
errors
.
It
should
therefore
be
clear
that
to
satisfy
the
objective
of
delivering
software
with
high
Q
&
P
,
processes
form
the
core
.
Consequently
,
in
software
engineering
,
the
focus
is
primarily
on
processes
,
which
are
referred
to
as
the
systematic
approach
in
the
definition
given
above
.
It
is
this
focus
on
process
that
distinguishes
software
engineering
from
most
other
computing
disciplines
.
Many
other
computing
disciplines
focus
on
some
type
of
product—operating
systems
,
databases
,
etc.—while
software
engineering
focuses
on
the
process
for
producing
the
products
.

A
Concise
Introduction
to
Software
Engineering
,
As
processes
form
the
heart
of
software
engineering
,
with
tools
and
tech-
nology
providing
support
to
efficiently
execute
the
processes
,
this
book
focuses
primarily
on
processes
.
In
this
chapter
we
will
discuss
:
Role
of
a
process
and
a
process
model
in
a
project
.
Various
component
processes
in
the
software
process
and
the
key
role
of
the
development
process
and
the
project
management
process
.
Various
models
for
the
development
process—waterfall
,
prototyping
,
itera-
tive
,
RUP
,
timeboxing
,
and
XP
.
The
overall
structure
of
the
project
management
process
and
its
key
phases
.
A
process
is
a
sequence
of
steps
performed
for
a
given
purpose
[
52
]
.
As
men-
tioned
earlier
,
while
developing
(
industrial
strength
)
software
,
the
purpose
is
to
develop
software
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
some
users
or
clients
,
as
shown
in
Figure
A
software
project
is
one
instance
of
this
problem
,
and
the
development
process
is
what
is
used
to
achieve
this
purpose
.
So
,
for
a
project
its
development
process
plays
a
key
role—it
is
by
following
the
process
the
desired
end
goal
of
delivering
the
software
is
achieved
.
However
,
as
discussed
earlier
,
it
is
not
sufficient
to
just
reach
the
final
goal
of
having
the
desired
software
,
but
we
want
that
the
project
be
done
at
low
cost
and
in
low
cycle
time
,
and
deliver
high-quality
software
.
The
role
of
process
increases
due
to
these
additional
goals
,
and
though
many
processes
can
achieve
the
basic
goal
of
developing
software
in
Figure
to
achieve
high
Q
&
P
we
need
some
“
optimum
”
process
.
It
is
this
goal
that
makes
designing
a
process
a
challenge
.
We
must
distinguish
process
specification
or
description
from
the
process
itself
.
A
process
is
a
dynamic
entity
which
captures
the
actions
performed
.
Process
specification
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
a
description
of
process
which
pre-
sumably
can
be
followed
in
some
project
to
achieve
the
goal
for
which
the
In
a
project
,
a
process
specification
may
be
used
as
the
process
the
project
plans
to
follow
.
The
actual
process
is
what
is
actually
done
in
the
project
.
Note
that
the
actual
process
can
be
different
from
the
planned
process
,
and
ensuring
that
the
specified
process
is
being
followed
is
a
nontrivial
problem
.
However
,
in
this
book
,
we
will
assume
that
the
planned
and
actual
processes
are
the
same
and
will
not
distinguish
between
the
two
and
will
use
the
term
process
to
refer
to
both
.
A
process
model
specifies
a
general
process
,
which
is
“
optimum
”
for
a
class
of
projects
.
That
is
,
in
the
situations
for
which
the
model
is
applicable
,
using
the
process
model
as
the
project
’
s
process
will
lead
to
the
goal
of
developing
software
with
high
Q
&
P
.
A
process
model
is
essentially
a
compilation
of
best
practices
into
a
“
recipe
”
for
success
in
the
project
.
In
other
words
,
a
process
is
a
means
to
reach
the
goals
of
high
quality
,
low
cost
,
and
low
cycle
time
,
and
a
process
model
provides
a
process
structure
that
is
well
suited
for
a
class
of
projects
.
A
process
is
often
specified
at
a
high
level
as
a
sequence
of
stages
.
The
sequence
of
steps
for
a
stage
is
the
process
for
that
stage
,
and
is
often
referred
to
as
a
subprocess
of
the
process
.
As
defined
above
,
a
process
is
the
sequence
of
steps
executed
to
achieve
a
goal
.
Since
many
different
goals
may
have
to
be
satisfied
while
developing
soft-
ware
,
multiple
processes
are
needed
.
Many
of
these
do
not
concern
software
engineering
,
though
they
do
impact
software
development
.
These
could
be
con-
sidered
nonsoftware
process
.
Business
processes
,
social
processes
,
and
training
processes
are
all
examples
of
processes
that
come
under
this
.
These
processes
also
affect
the
software
development
activity
but
are
beyond
the
purview
of
software
engineering
.
The
processes
that
deal
with
the
technical
and
management
issues
of
soft-
ware
development
are
collectively
called
the
software
process
.
As
a
software
project
will
have
to
engineer
a
solution
and
properly
manage
the
project
,
there
are
clearly
two
major
components
in
a
software
process—a
development
pro-
cess
and
a
project
management
process
.
The
development
process
specifies
all
the
engineering
activities
that
need
to
be
performed
,
whereas
the
management
process
specifies
how
to
plan
and
control
these
activities
so
that
cost
,
sched-
ule
,
quality
,
and
other
objectives
are
met
.
Effective
development
and
project
management
processes
are
the
key
to
achieving
the
objectives
of
delivering
the
desired
software
satisfying
the
user
needs
,
while
ensuring
high
productivity
and
quality
.
During
the
project
many
products
are
produced
which
are
typically
com-
posed
of
many
items
(
for
example
,
the
final
source
code
may
be
composed
of
many
source
files
)
.
These
items
keep
evolving
as
the
project
proceeds
,
creating
many
versions
on
the
way
.
As
development
processes
generally
do
not
focus
on
evolution
and
changes
,
to
handle
them
another
process
called
software
configu-
ration
control
process
is
often
used
.
The
objective
of
this
component
process
is
to
primarily
deal
with
managing
change
,
so
that
the
integrity
of
the
products
is
not
violated
despite
changes
.
These
three
constituent
processes
focus
on
the
projects
and
the
products
and
can
be
considered
as
comprising
the
product
engineering
processes
,
as
their
main
objective
is
to
produce
the
desired
product
.
If
the
software
process
can
be
viewed
as
a
static
entity
,
then
these
three
component
processes
will
suffice
.
However
,
a
software
process
itself
is
a
dynamic
entity
,
as
it
must
change
to
adapt
to
our
increased
understanding
about
software
development
and
availability
of
newer
technologies
and
tools
.
Due
to
this
,
a
process
to
manage
the
software
process
is
needed
.
The
basic
objective
of
the
process
management
process
is
to
improve
the
software
process
.
By
improvement
,
we
mean
that
the
capability
of
the
process
to
produce
quality
goods
at
low
cost
is
improved
.
For
this
,
the
current
software
process
is
studied
,
frequently
by
studying
the
projects
that
have
been
done
using
the
process
.
The
whole
process
of
understanding
the
current
process
,
analyzing
its
properties
,
determining
how
to
improve
,
and
then
affecting
the
improvement
is
dealt
with
by
the
process
management
process
.
The
relationship
between
these
major
component
processes
is
shown
in
Fig-
ure
These
component
processes
are
distinct
not
only
in
the
type
of
activities
performed
in
them
,
but
typically
also
in
the
people
who
perform
the
activities
specified
by
the
process
.
In
a
typical
project
,
development
activities
are
per-
formed
by
programmers
,
designers
,
testers
,
etc
.
;
the
project
management
pro-
cess
activities
are
performed
by
the
project
management
;
configuration
control
process
activities
are
performed
by
a
group
generally
called
the
configuration
controller
;
and
the
process
management
process
activities
are
performed
by
the
software
engineering
process
group
(
SEPG
)
.
In
this
book
,
we
will
focus
primarily
on
processes
relating
to
product
engineering
,
particularly
the
development
and
project
management
processes
.
Much
of
the
book
discusses
the
different
phases
of
a
development
process
and
the
subprocesses
or
methodologies
used
for
executing
these
phases
.
For
the
rest
of
the
book
,
we
will
use
the
term
software
process
to
mean
product
engineering
processes
,
unless
specified
otherwise
.
For
the
software
development
process
,
the
goal
is
to
produce
a
high-quality
software
product
.
It
therefore
focuses
on
activities
directly
related
to
production
of
the
software
,
for
example
,
design
,
coding
,
and
testing
.
As
the
development
process
specifies
the
major
development
and
quality
control
activities
that
need
to
be
performed
in
the
project
,
it
forms
the
core
of
the
software
process
.
The
management
process
is
often
decided
based
on
the
development
process
.
A
project
’
s
development
process
defines
the
tasks
the
project
should
per-
form
,
and
the
order
in
which
they
should
be
done
.
A
process
limits
the
degrees
of
freedom
for
a
project
by
specifying
what
types
of
activities
must
be
under-
taken
and
in
what
order
,
such
that
the
“
shortest
”
(
or
the
most
efficient
)
path
is
obtained
from
the
user
needs
to
the
software
satisfying
these
needs
.
The
process
drives
a
project
and
heavily
influences
the
outcome
.
As
discussed
earlier
,
a
process
model
specifies
a
general
process
,
usually
as
a
set
of
stages
in
which
a
project
should
be
divided
,
the
order
in
which
the
stages
should
be
executed
,
and
any
other
constraints
and
conditions
on
the
execution
of
stages
.
The
basic
premise
behind
a
process
model
is
that
,
in
the
situations
for
which
the
model
is
applicable
,
using
the
process
model
as
the
project
’
s
process
will
lead
to
low
cost
,
high
quality
,
reduced
cycle
time
,
or
provide
other
benefits
.
In
other
words
,
the
process
model
provides
generic
guidelines
for
developing
a
suitable
process
for
a
project
.
Due
to
the
importance
of
the
development
process
,
various
models
have
been
proposed
.
In
this
section
we
will
discuss
some
of
the
major
models
.
The
simplest
process
model
is
the
waterfall
model
,
which
states
that
the
phases
are
organized
in
a
linear
order
.
The
model
was
originally
proposed
by
Royce
[
74
]
,
though
variations
of
the
model
have
evolved
depending
on
the
nature
of
activities
and
the
flow
of
control
between
them
.
In
this
model
,
a
project
be-
gins
with
feasibility
analysis
.
Upon
successfully
demonstrating
the
feasibility
of
a
project
,
the
requirements
analysis
and
project
planning
begins
.
The
design
starts
after
the
requirements
analysis
is
complete
,
and
coding
begins
after
the
design
is
complete
.
Once
the
programming
is
completed
,
the
code
is
integrated
and
testing
is
done
.
Upon
successful
completion
of
testing
,
the
system
is
in-
stalled
.
After
this
,
the
regular
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
system
takes
place
.
The
model
is
shown
in
Figure
The
basic
idea
behind
the
phases
is
separation
of
concerns—each
phase
deals
with
a
distinct
and
separate
set
of
concerns
.
By
doing
this
,
the
large
and
complex
task
of
building
the
software
is
broken
into
smaller
tasks
(
which
,
by
themselves
,
are
still
quite
complex
)
of
specifying
requirements
,
doing
design
,
etc
.
Separating
the
concerns
and
focusing
on
a
select
few
in
a
phase
gives
a
better
handle
to
the
engineers
and
managers
in
dealing
with
the
complexity
of
the
problem
.
The
requirements
analysis
phase
is
mentioned
as
“
analysis
and
planning.
”
Planning
is
a
critical
activity
in
software
development
.
A
good
plan
is
based
on
the
requirements
of
the
system
and
should
be
done
before
later
phases
begin
.
However
,
in
practice
,
detailed
requirements
are
not
necessary
for
planning
.
Consequently
,
planning
usually
overlaps
with
the
requirements
analysis
,
and
a
plan
is
ready
before
the
later
phases
begin
.
This
plan
is
an
additional
input
to
all
the
later
phases
.
Linear
ordering
of
activities
has
some
important
consequences
.
First
,
to
clearly
identify
the
end
of
a
phase
and
the
beginning
of
the
next
,
some
cer-
tification
mechanism
has
to
be
employed
at
the
end
of
each
phase
.
This
is
usually
done
by
some
verification
and
validation
means
that
will
ensure
that
the
output
of
a
phase
is
consistent
with
its
input
(
which
is
the
output
of
the
previous
phase
)
,
and
that
the
output
of
the
phase
is
consistent
with
the
overall
requirements
of
the
system
.
The
consequence
of
the
need
for
certification
is
that
each
phase
must
have
some
defined
output
that
can
be
evaluated
and
certified
.
That
is
,
when
the
ac-
tivities
of
a
phase
are
completed
,
there
should
be
some
product
that
is
produced
by
that
phase
.
The
outputs
of
the
earlier
phases
are
often
called
work
products
and
are
usually
in
the
form
of
documents
like
the
requirements
document
or
design
document
.
For
the
coding
phase
,
the
output
is
the
code
.
Though
the
set
of
documents
that
should
be
produced
in
a
project
is
dependent
on
how
the
process
is
implemented
,
the
following
documents
generally
form
a
reasonable
set
that
should
be
produced
in
each
project
:
One
of
the
main
advantages
of
the
waterfall
model
is
its
simplicity
.
It
is
concep-
tually
straightforward
and
divides
the
large
task
of
building
a
software
system
into
a
series
of
cleanly
divided
phases
,
each
phase
dealing
with
a
separate
logi-
cal
concern
.
It
is
also
easy
to
administer
in
a
contractual
setup—as
each
phase
is
completed
and
its
work
product
produced
,
some
amount
of
money
is
given
by
the
customer
to
the
developing
organization
.
The
waterfall
model
,
although
widely
used
,
has
some
strong
limitations
.
It
assumes
that
the
requirements
of
a
system
can
be
frozen
(
i.e.
,
baselined
)
before
the
design
begins
.
This
is
possible
for
systems
designed
to
automate
an
existing
manual
system
.
But
for
new
systems
,
determining
the
require-
ments
is
difficult
as
the
user
does
not
even
know
the
requirements
.
Hence
,
having
unchanging
requirements
is
unrealistic
for
such
projects
.
Freezing
the
requirements
usually
requires
choosing
the
hardware
(
because
it
forms
a
part
of
the
requirements
specification
)
.
A
large
project
might
take
a
few
years
to
complete
.
If
the
hardware
is
selected
early
,
then
due
to
the
speed
at
which
hardware
technology
is
changing
,
it
is
likely
that
the
final
software
will
use
a
hardware
technology
on
the
verge
of
becoming
obsolete
.
This
is
clearly
not
desirable
for
such
expensive
software
systems
.
It
follows
the
“
big
bang
”
approach—the
entire
software
is
delivered
in
one
shot
at
the
end
.
This
entails
heavy
risks
,
as
the
user
does
not
know
until
the
very
end
what
they
are
getting
.
Furthermore
,
if
the
project
runs
out
of
money
in
the
middle
,
then
there
will
be
no
software
.
That
is
,
it
has
the
“
all
or
nothing
”
value
proposition
.
It
encourages
“
requirements
bloating
”
.
Since
all
requirements
must
be
spec-
ified
at
the
start
and
only
what
is
specified
will
be
delivered
,
it
encourages
the
users
and
other
stakeholders
to
add
even
those
features
which
they
think
might
be
needed
(
which
finally
may
not
get
used
)
.
It
is
a
document-driven
process
that
requires
formal
documents
at
the
end
of
each
phase
.
Despite
these
limitations
,
the
waterfall
model
has
been
the
most
widely
used
process
model
.
It
is
well
suited
for
routine
types
of
projects
where
the
require-
ments
are
well
understood
.
That
is
,
if
the
developing
organization
is
quite
fa-
miliar
with
the
problem
domain
and
the
requirements
for
the
software
are
quite
clear
,
the
waterfall
model
works
well
,
and
may
be
the
most
efficient
process
.
The
goal
of
a
prototyping-based
development
process
is
to
counter
the
first
limitation
of
the
waterfall
model
.
The
basic
idea
here
is
that
instead
of
freezing
the
requirements
before
any
design
or
coding
can
proceed
,
a
throwaway
proto-
type
is
built
to
help
understand
the
requirements
.
This
prototype
is
developed
based
on
the
currently
known
requirements
.
Development
of
the
prototype
ob-
viously
undergoes
design
,
coding
,
and
testing
,
but
each
of
these
phases
is
not
done
very
formally
or
thoroughly
.
By
using
this
prototype
,
the
client
can
get
an
actual
feel
of
the
system
,
which
can
enable
the
client
to
better
understand
the
requirements
of
the
desired
system
.
This
results
in
more
stable
requirements
that
change
less
frequently
.
Prototyping
is
an
attractive
idea
for
complicated
and
large
systems
for
which
there
is
no
manual
process
or
existing
system
to
help
determine
the
requirements
.
In
such
situations
,
letting
the
client
“
play
”
with
the
prototype
provides
invaluable
and
intangible
inputs
that
help
determine
the
requirements
for
the
system
.
It
is
also
an
effective
method
of
demonstrating
the
feasibility
of
a
certain
approach
.
This
might
be
needed
for
novel
systems
,
where
it
is
not
clear
that
constraints
can
be
met
or
that
algorithms
can
be
developed
to
implement
the
requirements
.
In
both
situations
,
the
risks
associated
with
the
projects
are
being
reduced
through
the
use
of
prototyping
.
The
process
model
of
the
prototyping
approach
is
shown
in
Figure
A
development
process
using
throwaway
prototyping
typically
proceeds
as
follows
[
40
]
.
The
development
of
the
prototype
typically
starts
when
the
prelim-
inary
version
of
the
requirements
specification
document
has
been
developed
.
At
this
stage
,
there
is
a
reasonable
understanding
of
the
system
and
its
needs
and
which
needs
are
unclear
or
likely
to
change
.
After
the
prototype
has
been
developed
,
the
end
users
and
clients
are
given
an
opportunity
to
use
and
ex-
plore
the
prototype
.
Based
on
their
experience
,
they
provide
feedback
to
the
developers
regarding
the
prototype
:
what
is
correct
,
what
needs
to
be
modified
,
what
is
missing
,
what
is
not
needed
,
etc
.
Based
on
the
feedback
,
the
prototype
is
modified
to
incorporate
some
of
the
suggested
changes
that
can
be
done
easily
,
and
then
the
users
and
the
clients
are
again
allowed
to
use
the
system
.
This
cycle
repeats
until
,
in
the
judgment
of
the
prototype
developers
and
an-
alysts
,
the
benefit
from
further
changing
the
system
and
obtaining
feedback
is
outweighed
by
the
cost
and
time
involved
in
making
the
changes
and
obtaining
the
feedback
.
Based
on
the
feedback
,
the
initial
requirements
are
modified
to
produce
the
final
requirements
specification
,
which
is
then
used
to
develop
the
production
quality
system
.
For
prototyping
for
the
purposes
of
requirement
analysis
to
be
feasible
,
its
cost
must
be
kept
low
.
Consequently
,
only
those
features
are
included
in
the
prototype
that
will
have
a
valuable
return
from
the
user
experience
.
Excep-
tion
handling
,
recovery
,
and
conformance
to
some
standards
and
formats
are
typically
not
included
in
prototypes
.
In
prototyping
,
as
the
prototype
is
to
be
discarded
,
there
is
no
point
in
implementing
those
parts
of
the
requirements
that
are
already
well
understood
.
Hence
,
the
focus
of
the
development
is
to
include
those
features
that
are
not
properly
understood
.
And
the
development
approach
is
“
quick
and
dirty
”
with
the
focus
on
quick
development
rather
than
quality
.
Because
the
prototype
is
to
be
thrown
away
,
only
minimal
documenta-
tion
needs
to
be
produced
during
prototyping
.
For
example
,
design
documents
,
a
test
plan
,
and
a
test
case
specification
are
not
needed
during
the
development
of
the
prototype
.
Another
important
cost-cutting
measure
is
to
reduce
testing
.
Because
testing
consumes
a
major
part
of
development
expenditure
during
reg-
ular
software
development
,
this
has
a
considerable
impact
in
reducing
costs
.
By
using
these
types
of
cost-cutting
methods
,
it
is
possible
to
keep
the
cost
of
the
prototype
to
less
than
a
few
percent
of
the
total
development
cost
.
And
the
returns
from
this
extra
cost
can
be
substantial
.
First
,
the
experience
of
developing
the
prototype
will
reduce
the
cost
of
the
actual
software
develop-
ment
.
Second
,
as
requirements
will
be
more
stable
now
due
to
the
feedback
from
the
prototype
,
there
will
be
fewer
changes
in
the
requirements
.
Consequently
the
costs
incurred
due
to
changes
in
the
requirements
will
be
substantially
re-
duced
.
Third
,
the
quality
of
final
software
is
likely
to
be
far
superior
,
as
the
experience
engineers
have
obtained
while
developing
the
prototype
will
enable
them
to
create
a
better
design
,
write
better
code
,
and
do
better
testing
.
And
fi-
nally
,
developing
a
prototype
mitigates
many
risks
that
exist
in
a
project
where
requirements
are
not
well
known
.
Overall
,
prototyping
is
well
suited
for
projects
where
requirements
are
hard
to
determine
and
the
confidence
in
the
stated
requirements
is
low
.
In
such
projects
where
requirements
are
not
properly
understood
in
the
beginning
,
using
the
prototyping
process
model
can
be
the
most
effective
method
for
developing
the
software
.
It
is
also
an
excellent
technique
for
reducing
some
types
of
risks
associated
with
a
project
.
The
iterative
development
process
model
counters
the
third
and
fourth
limita-
tions
of
the
waterfall
model
and
tries
to
combine
the
benefits
of
both
proto-
typing
and
the
waterfall
model
.
The
basic
idea
is
that
the
software
should
be
developed
in
increments
,
each
increment
adding
some
functional
capability
to
the
system
until
the
full
system
is
implemented
.
The
iterative
enhancement
model
[
4
]
is
an
example
of
this
approach
.
In
the
first
step
of
this
model
,
a
simple
initial
implementation
is
done
for
a
subset
of
the
overall
problem
.
This
subset
is
one
that
contains
some
of
the
key
aspects
of
the
problem
that
are
easy
to
understand
and
implement
and
which
form
a
useful
and
usable
system
.
A
project
control
list
is
created
that
contains
,
in
order
,
all
the
tasks
that
must
be
performed
to
obtain
the
final
implementation
.
This
project
control
list
gives
an
idea
of
how
far
along
the
project
is
at
any
given
step
from
the
final
system
.
Each
step
consists
of
removing
the
next
task
from
the
list
,
designing
the
implementation
for
the
selected
task
,
coding
and
testing
the
implementation
,
performing
an
analysis
of
the
partial
system
obtained
after
this
step
,
and
updat-
ing
the
list
as
a
result
of
the
analysis
.
These
three
phases
are
called
the
design
phase
,
implementation
phase
,
and
analysis
phase
.
The
process
is
iterated
until
the
project
control
list
is
empty
,
at
which
time
the
final
implementation
of
the
system
will
be
available
.
The
iterative
enhancement
model
is
shown
in
Figure
The
project
control
list
guides
the
iteration
steps
and
keeps
track
of
all
tasks
that
must
be
done
.
Based
on
the
analysis
,
one
of
the
tasks
in
the
list
can
include
redesign
of
defective
components
or
redesign
of
the
entire
system
.
However
,
redesign
of
the
system
will
generally
occur
only
in
the
initial
steps
.
In
the
later
steps
,
the
design
would
have
stabilized
and
there
is
less
chance
of
redesign
.
Each
entry
in
the
list
is
a
task
that
should
be
performed
in
one
step
of
the
iterative
enhancement
process
and
should
be
simple
enough
to
be
completely
understood
.
Selecting
tasks
in
this
manner
will
minimize
the
chances
of
error
and
reduce
the
redesign
work
.
The
design
and
implementation
phases
of
each
step
can
be
performed
in
a
top-down
manner
or
by
using
some
other
technique
.
Though
there
are
clear
benefits
of
iterative
development
,
particularly
in
allowing
changing
requirements
,
not
having
the
all-or-nothing
risk
,
etc.
,
there
are
some
costs
associated
with
iterative
development
also
.
For
example
,
as
the
requirements
for
future
iterations
are
not
known
,
the
design
of
a
system
may
not
be
too
robust
.
Also
,
changes
may
have
to
be
made
to
the
existing
system
to
accommodate
requirements
of
the
future
iterations
,
leading
to
extra
rework
and/or
discarding
of
work
done
earlier
.
Overall
,
it
may
not
offer
the
best
technical
solution
,
but
the
benefits
may
outweigh
the
costs
in
many
projects
.
Another
common
approach
for
iterative
development
is
to
do
the
require-
ments
and
the
architecture
design
in
a
standard
waterfall
or
prototyping
ap-
proach
,
but
deliver
the
software
iteratively
.
That
is
,
the
building
of
the
system
,
which
is
the
most
time
and
effort-consuming
task
,
is
done
iteratively
,
though
most
of
the
requirements
are
specified
upfront
.
We
can
view
this
approach
as
having
one
iteration
delivering
the
requirements
and
the
architecture
plan
,
and
then
further
iterations
delivering
the
software
in
increments
.
At
the
start
of
each
delivery
iteration
,
which
requirements
will
be
implemented
in
this
release
are
decided
,
and
then
the
design
is
enhanced
and
code
developed
to
implement
the
requirements
.
The
iteration
ends
with
delivery
of
a
working
software
system
providing
some
value
to
the
end
user
.
Selecting
of
requirements
for
an
iteration
is
done
primarily
based
on
the
value
the
requirement
provides
to
the
end
users
and
how
critical
they
are
for
supporting
other
requirements
.
This
approach
is
shown
in
Figure
The
advantage
of
this
approach
is
that
as
the
requirements
are
mostly
known
upfront
,
an
overall
view
of
the
system
is
available
and
a
proper
archi-
tecture
can
be
designed
which
can
remain
relatively
stable
.
With
this
,
hopefully
rework
in
development
iterations
will
diminish
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
value
to
the
end
customer
is
delivered
iteratively
so
it
does
not
have
the
all-or-nothing
risk
.
Also
,
since
the
delivery
is
being
done
incrementally
,
and
planning
and
execution
of
each
iteration
is
done
separately
,
feedback
from
an
iteration
can
be
incorporated
in
the
next
iteration
.
Even
new
requirements
that
may
get
un-
covered
can
also
be
incorporated
.
Hence
,
this
model
of
iterative
development
also
provides
some
of
the
benefits
of
the
model
discussed
above
.
The
iterative
approach
is
becoming
extremely
popular
,
despite
some
diffi-
culties
in
using
it
in
this
context
.
There
are
a
few
key
reasons
for
its
increasing
popularity
.
First
and
foremost
,
in
today
’
s
world
clients
do
not
want
to
invest
too
much
without
seeing
returns
.
In
the
current
business
scenario
,
it
is
preferable
to
see
returns
continuously
of
the
investment
made
.
The
iterative
model
per-
mits
this—after
each
iteration
some
working
software
is
delivered
,
and
the
risk
to
the
client
is
therefore
limited
.
Second
,
as
businesses
are
changing
rapidly
today
,
they
never
really
know
the
“
complete
”
requirements
for
the
software
,
and
there
is
a
need
to
constantly
add
new
capabilities
to
the
software
to
adapt
the
business
to
changing
situations
.
Iterative
process
allows
this
.
Third
,
each
iteration
provides
a
working
system
for
feedback
,
which
helps
in
developing
stable
requirements
for
the
next
iteration
.
Below
we
will
describe
some
other
process
models
,
all
of
them
using
some
iterative
approach
.
Rational
Unified
Process
(
RUP
)
[
51
,
63
]
is
another
iterative
process
model
that
was
designed
by
Rational
,
now
part
of
IBM
.
Though
it
is
a
general
pro-
cess
model
,
it
was
designed
for
object-oriented
development
using
the
Unified
Modeling
Language
(
UML
)
.
(
We
will
discuss
these
topics
in
a
later
chapter
)
.
RUP
proposes
that
development
of
software
be
divided
into
cycles
,
each
cycle
delivering
a
fully
working
system
.
Generally
,
each
cycle
is
executed
as
a
separate
project
whose
goal
is
to
deliver
some
additional
capability
to
an
exist-
ing
system
(
built
by
the
previous
cycle
)
.
Hence
,
for
a
project
,
the
process
for
a
cycle
forms
the
overall
process
.
Each
cycle
itself
is
broken
into
four
consecutive
phases
:
Each
phase
has
a
distinct
purpose
,
and
completion
of
each
phase
is
a
well-
defined
milestone
in
the
project
with
some
clearly
defined
outputs
.
The
purpose
of
the
inception
phase
is
to
establish
the
goals
and
scope
of
the
project
,
and
completion
of
this
phase
is
the
lifecycle
objectives
milestone
.
This
milestone
should
specify
the
vision
and
high-level
capability
of
the
eventual
system
,
what
business
benefits
it
is
expected
to
provide
,
some
key
illustrative
use
cases
of
the
system
,
key
risks
of
the
project
,
and
a
basic
plan
of
the
project
regarding
the
cost
and
schedule
.
Based
on
the
output
of
this
phase
,
a
go/no-go
decision
may
be
taken
.
And
if
the
project
is
to
proceed
,
then
this
milestone
represents
that
there
is
a
shared
vision
among
the
stakeholders
and
they
agree
to
the
project
,
its
vision
,
benefits
,
cost
,
usage
,
etc
.
In
the
elaboration
phase
,
the
architecture
of
the
system
is
designed
,
based
on
the
detailed
requirements
analysis
.
The
completion
of
this
phase
is
the
life-
cycle
architecture
milestone
.
At
the
end
of
this
phase
,
it
is
expected
that
most
of
the
requirements
have
been
identified
and
specified
,
and
the
architecture
of
the
system
has
been
designed
(
and
specified
)
in
a
manner
that
it
addresses
the
technical
risks
identified
in
the
earlier
phase
.
In
addition
,
a
high-level
project
plan
for
the
project
has
been
prepared
showing
the
remaining
phases
and
iter-
ations
in
those
,
and
the
current
perception
of
risks
.
By
the
end
of
this
phase
,
the
critical
engineering
decisions
regarding
the
choice
of
technologies
,
architec-
ture
,
etc
.
have
been
taken
,
and
a
detailed
understanding
of
the
project
exists
.
Outputs
of
this
milestone
allow
technical
evaluation
of
the
proposed
solution
,
as
well
as
a
better
informed
decision
about
cost-benefit
analysis
of
the
project
.
In
the
construction
phase
,
the
software
is
built
and
tested
.
This
phase
results
in
the
software
product
to
be
delivered
,
along
with
associated
user
and
other
manuals
,
and
successfully
completing
this
phase
results
in
the
initial
operational
capability
milestone
being
achieved
.
The
purpose
of
the
transition
phase
is
to
move
the
software
from
the
devel-
opment
environment
to
the
client
’
s
environment
,
where
it
is
to
be
hosted
.
This
is
a
complex
task
which
can
require
additional
testing
,
conversion
of
old
data
for
this
software
to
work
,
training
of
personnel
,
etc
.
The
successful
execution
of
this
phase
results
in
achieving
the
milestone
product
release
.
The
different
phases
and
milestones
in
RUP
are
shown
in
Figure
Though
these
phases
are
consecutive
,
each
phase
itself
may
have
multiple
iterations
,
with
each
iteration
delivering
to
an
internal
or
external
customer
some
well-defined
output
which
is
often
a
part
of
the
final
deliverable
of
that
phase
’
s
milestone
.
Generally
,
it
is
expected
that
the
construction
phase
will
be
broken
into
multiple
iterations
,
each
iteration
producing
a
working
system
which
can
be
used
for
feedback
,
evaluation
,
beta-testing
,
etc
.
Though
itera-
tions
in
construction
are
done
often
and
it
is
clear
what
an
iteration
in
this
phase
delivers
,
iterations
may
be
done
meaningfully
in
other
phases
as
well
.
For
example
,
in
the
elaboration
phase
,
the
first
iteration
may
just
specify
the
overall
architecture
and
high-level
requirements
,
while
the
second
iteration
may
be
done
to
thrash
out
the
details
.
As
another
example
,
there
may
be
multiple
iterations
to
transition
the
developed
software
,
with
each
iteration
“
making
live
”
some
part
or
some
feature
of
the
developed
software
.
RUP
has
carefully
chosen
the
phase
names
so
as
not
to
confuse
them
with
the
engineering
tasks
that
are
to
be
done
in
the
project
,
as
in
RUP
the
en-
gineering
tasks
and
phases
are
separate
.
Different
engineering
activities
may
be
performed
in
a
phase
to
achieve
its
milestones
.
RUP
groups
the
activities
into
different
subprocesses
which
it
calls
core
process
workflows
.
These
sub-
processes
correspond
to
the
tasks
of
performing
requirements
analysis
,
doing
design
,
implementing
the
design
,
testing
,
project
management
,
etc
.
Some
of
the
subprocesses
are
shown
in
Table
One
key
difference
of
RUP
from
other
models
is
that
it
has
separated
the
phases
from
the
tasks
and
allows
multiple
of
these
subprocesses
to
function
within
a
phase
.
In
waterfall
(
or
waterfall-based
iterative
model
)
,
a
phase
within
a
process
was
linked
to
a
particular
task
performed
by
some
process
like
re-
quirements
,
design
,
etc
.
In
RUP
these
tasks
are
separated
from
the
stages
,
and
it
allows
,
for
example
,
during
construction
,
execution
of
the
requirements
process
.
That
is
,
it
allows
some
part
of
the
requirement
activity
be
done
even
in
construction
,
something
the
waterfall
did
not
allow
.
So
,
a
project
,
if
it
so
wishes
,
may
do
detailed
requirements
only
for
some
features
during
the
elabora-
tion
phase
,
and
may
do
detailing
of
other
requirements
while
the
construction
is
going
on
(
maybe
the
first
iteration
of
it
)
.
This
not
only
allows
a
project
a
greater
degree
of
flexibility
in
planning
when
the
different
tasks
should
be
done
,
it
also
captures
the
reality
of
the
situation—it
is
often
not
possible
to
specify
all
requirements
at
the
start
and
it
is
best
to
start
the
project
with
some
requirements
and
work
out
the
details
later
.
Though
a
subprocess
may
be
active
in
many
phases
,
as
can
be
expected
,
the
volume
of
work
or
the
effort
being
spent
on
the
subprocess
will
vary
with
phases
.
For
example
,
it
is
expected
that
a
lot
more
effort
will
be
spent
in
the
requirement
subprocess
during
elaboration
,
and
less
will
be
spent
in
construc-
tion
,
and
still
less
,
if
any
,
will
be
spent
in
transition
.
Similarly
,
the
model
has
the
development
process
active
in
elaboration
,
which
allows
a
project
to
build
a
prototype
during
the
elaboration
phase
to
help
its
requirements
activity
,
if
needed
.
However
,
most
of
the
implementation
does
happen
in
the
construction
phase
.
The
effort
spent
in
a
subprocess
in
different
phases
will
,
of
course
,
de-
pend
on
the
project
.
However
,
a
general
pattern
is
indicated
in
Table
by
specifying
if
the
level
of
effort
for
the
phase
is
high
,
medium
,
low
,
etc
.
Overall
,
RUP
provides
a
flexible
process
model
,
which
follows
an
iterative
approach
not
only
at
a
top
level
(
through
cycles
)
,
but
also
encourages
iterative
approach
during
each
of
the
phases
in
a
cycle
.
And
in
phases
,
it
allows
the
different
tasks
to
be
done
as
per
the
needs
of
the
project
.
To
speed
up
development
,
parallelism
between
the
different
iterations
can
be
employed
.
That
is
,
a
new
iteration
commences
before
the
system
produced
by
the
current
iteration
is
released
,
and
hence
development
of
a
new
release
happens
in
parallel
with
the
development
of
the
current
release
.
By
starting
an
iteration
before
the
previous
iteration
has
completed
,
it
is
possible
to
reduce
the
average
delivery
time
for
iterations
.
However
,
to
support
parallel
execution
,
each
iteration
has
to
be
structured
properly
and
teams
have
to
be
organized
suitably
.
The
timeboxing
model
proposes
an
approach
for
these
[
60
,
59
]
.
In
the
timeboxing
model
,
the
basic
unit
of
development
is
a
time
box
,
which
is
of
fixed
duration
.
Since
the
duration
is
fixed
,
a
key
factor
in
selecting
the
requirements
or
features
to
be
built
in
a
time
box
is
what
can
be
fit
into
the
time
box
.
This
is
in
contrast
to
regular
iterative
approaches
where
the
functionality
is
selected
and
then
the
time
to
deliver
is
determined
.
Timeboxing
changes
the
perspective
of
development
and
makes
the
schedule
a
nonnegotiable
and
a
high-priority
commitment
.
Each
time
box
is
divided
into
a
sequence
of
stages
,
like
in
the
waterfall
model
.
Each
stage
performs
some
clearly
defined
task
for
the
iteration
and
produces
a
clearly
defined
output
.
The
model
also
requires
that
the
duration
of
each
stage
,
that
is
,
the
time
it
takes
to
complete
the
task
of
that
stage
,
is
approximately
the
same
.
Furthermore
,
the
model
requires
that
there
be
a
dedicated
team
for
each
stage
.
That
is
,
the
team
for
a
stage
performs
only
tasks
of
that
stage—tasks
for
other
stages
are
performed
by
their
respective
teams
.
This
is
quite
different
from
other
iterative
models
where
the
implicit
assumption
is
that
the
same
team
performs
all
the
different
tasks
of
the
project
or
the
iteration
.
Having
time-boxed
iterations
with
stages
of
equal
duration
and
having
ded-
icated
teams
renders
itself
to
pipelining
of
different
iterations
.
(
Pipelining
is
a
concept
from
hardware
in
which
different
instructions
are
executed
in
paral-
lel
,
with
the
execution
of
a
new
instruction
starting
once
the
first
stage
of
the
previous
instruction
is
finished
.
)
To
illustrate
the
use
of
this
model
,
consider
a
time
box
consisting
of
three
stages
:
requirement
specification
,
build
,
and
deployment
.
The
require-
ment
stage
is
executed
by
its
team
of
analysts
and
ends
with
a
prioritized
list
of
requirements
to
be
built
in
this
iteration
along
with
a
high-level
design
.
The
build
team
develops
the
code
for
implementing
the
requirements
,
and
performs
the
testing
.
The
tested
code
is
then
handed
over
to
the
deployment
team
,
which
performs
predeployment
tests
,
and
then
installs
the
system
for
production
use
.
These
three
stages
are
such
that
they
can
be
done
in
approximately
equal
time
in
an
iteration
.
With
a
time
box
of
three
stages
,
the
project
proceeds
as
follows
.
When
the
requirements
team
has
finished
requirements
for
timebox-1
,
the
requirements
are
given
to
the
build
team
for
building
the
software
.
The
requirements
team
then
goes
on
and
starts
preparing
the
requirements
for
timebox-2
.
When
the
build
for
timebox-
,
the
code
is
handed
over
to
the
deployment
team
,
and
the
build
team
moves
on
to
build
code
for
requirements
for
timebox-
2
,
and
the
requirements
team
moves
on
to
doing
requirements
for
timebox-3
.
This
pipelined
execution
of
the
timeboxing
process
is
shown
in
Figure
[
59
]
.
With
a
three-stage
time
box
,
at
most
three
iterations
can
be
concurrently
in
progress
.
If
the
time
box
is
of
size
T
days
,
then
the
first
software
delivery
will
occur
after
T
days
.
The
subsequent
deliveries
,
however
,
will
take
place
after
every
T/
.
For
example
,
if
the
time
box
duration
T
is
(
and
each
stage
duration
is
)
,
the
first
delivery
is
made
.
The
second
delivery
is
made
after
1
,
the
third
after
1
,
and
so
on
.
Contrast
this
with
a
linear
execution
of
iterations
,
in
which
the
first
delivery
will
be
made
after
,
the
second
after
1
,
the
third
after
2
,
and
so
on
.
There
are
three
teams
working
on
the
project—the
requirements
team
,
the
build
team
,
and
the
deployment
team
.
The
teamwise
activity
for
the
3-stage
pipeline
discussed
above
is
shown
in
Figure
[
59
]
.
It
should
be
clear
that
the
duration
of
each
iteration
has
not
been
reduced
.
The
total
work
done
in
a
time
box
and
the
effort
spent
in
it
also
remains
the
same—the
same
amount
of
software
is
delivered
at
the
end
of
each
iteration
as
the
time
box
undergoes
the
same
stages
.
If
the
effort
and
time
spent
in
each
iteration
also
remains
the
same
,
then
what
is
the
cost
of
reducing
the
delivery
time
?
The
real
cost
of
this
reduced
time
is
in
the
resources
used
in
this
model
.
With
timeboxing
,
there
are
dedicated
teams
for
different
stages
and
the
total
team
size
for
the
project
is
the
sum
of
teams
of
different
stages
.
This
is
the
main
difference
from
the
situation
where
there
is
a
single
team
which
performs
all
the
stages
and
the
entire
team
works
on
the
same
iteration
.
Hence
,
the
timeboxing
provides
an
approach
for
utilizing
additional
man-
power
to
reduce
the
delivery
time
.
It
is
well
known
that
with
standard
methods
of
executing
projects
,
we
can
not
compress
the
cycle
time
of
a
project
substan-
tially
by
adding
more
manpower
.
However
,
through
the
timeboxing
model
,
we
can
use
more
manpower
in
a
manner
such
that
by
parallel
execution
of
different
stages
we
are
able
to
deliver
software
quicker
.
In
other
words
,
it
provides
a
way
of
shortening
delivery
times
through
the
use
of
additional
manpower
.
Timeboxing
is
well
suited
for
projects
that
require
a
large
number
of
fea-
tures
to
be
developed
in
a
short
time
around
a
stable
architecture
using
stable
technologies
.
These
features
should
be
such
that
there
is
some
flexibility
in
grouping
them
for
building
a
meaningful
system
in
an
iteration
that
provides
value
to
the
users
.
The
main
cost
of
this
model
is
the
increased
complexity
of
project
management
(
and
managing
the
products
being
developed
)
as
multiple
developments
are
concurrently
active
.
Also
,
the
impact
of
unusual
situations
in
an
iteration
can
be
quite
disruptive
.
Further
details
about
the
model
,
as
well
as
a
detailed
example
of
applying
the
model
on
a
real
commercial
project
,
are
given
in
[
60
,

]
.
Agile
development
approaches
evolved
in
the
1990s
as
a
reaction
to
documen-
tation
and
bureaucracy-based
processes
,
particularly
the
waterfall
approach
.
Agile
approaches
are
based
on
some
common
principles
,
some
of
which
are
x
Working
software
is
the
key
measure
of
progress
in
a
project
.
For
progress
in
a
project
,
therefore
,
software
should
be
developed
and
deliv-
ered
rapidly
in
small
increments
.
Even
late
changes
in
the
requirements
should
be
entertained
(
small-increment
model
of
development
helps
in
accommodating
them
)
.
Face-to-face
communication
is
preferred
over
documentation
.
Continuous
feedback
and
involvement
of
customer
is
necessary
for
developing
good-quality
software
.
Simple
design
which
evolves
and
improves
with
time
is
a
better
approach
than
doing
an
elaborate
design
up
front
for
handling
all
possible
scenarios
.
The
delivery
dates
are
decided
by
empowered
teams
of
talented
individuals
(
and
are
not
dictated
)
.
Many
detailed
agile
methodologies
have
been
proposed
,
some
of
which
are
widely
used
now
.
Extreme
programming
(
XP
)
is
one
of
the
most
popular
and
well-known
approaches
in
the
family
of
agile
methods
.
Like
all
agile
approaches
,
it
believes
that
changes
are
inevitable
and
rather
than
treating
changes
as
un-
desirable
,
development
should
embrace
change
.
And
to
accommodate
change
,
the
development
process
has
to
be
lightweight
and
quick
to
respond
.
For
this
,
it
develops
software
iteratively
,
and
avoids
reliance
on
detailed
and
multiple
documents
which
are
hard
to
maintain
.
Instead
it
relies
on
face-to-face
com-
munication
,
simplicity
,
and
feedback
to
ensure
that
the
desired
changes
are
quickly
and
correctly
reflected
in
the
programs
.
Here
we
briefly
discuss
the
development
process
of
XP
,
as
a
representative
of
an
agile
process
.
An
extreme
programming
project
starts
with
user
stories
which
are
short
(
a
few
sentences
)
descriptions
of
what
scenarios
the
customers
and
users
would
like
the
system
to
support
.
They
are
different
from
traditional
requirements
specification
primarily
in
details—user
stories
do
not
contain
detailed
require-
ments
which
are
to
be
uncovered
only
when
the
story
is
to
be
implemented
,
therefore
allowing
the
details
to
be
decided
as
late
as
possible
.
Each
story
is
written
on
a
separate
card
,
so
they
can
be
flexibly
grouped
.
The
empowered
development
team
estimates
how
long
it
will
take
to
imple-
ment
a
user
story
.
The
estimates
are
rough
,
generally
stated
in
weeks
.
Using
these
estimates
and
the
stories
,
release
planning
is
done
which
defines
which
stories
are
to
be
built
in
which
system
release
,
and
the
dates
of
these
releases
.
Frequent
and
small
releases
are
encouraged
,
and
for
a
release
,
iterations
are
employed
.
Acceptance
tests
are
also
built
from
the
stories
,
which
are
used
to
test
the
software
before
the
release
.
Bugs
found
during
the
acceptance
testing
for
an
iteration
can
form
work
items
for
the
next
iteration
.
This
overall
process
is
shown
in
Figure
Development
is
done
in
iterations
,
each
iteration
lasting
no
more
than
a
few
weeks
.
An
iteration
starts
with
iteration
planning
in
which
the
stories
to
be
implemented
in
this
iteration
are
selected—high-value
and
high-risk
stories
are
considered
as
higher
priority
and
implemented
in
early
iterations
.
Failed
acceptance
tests
in
previous
iteration
also
have
to
be
handled
.
Details
of
the
stories
are
obtained
in
the
iteration
for
doing
the
development
.
The
development
approach
used
in
an
iteration
has
some
unique
practices
.
First
,
it
envisages
that
development
is
done
by
pairs
of
programmers
(
called
pair
programming
and
which
we
will
discuss
further
in
Chapter
7
)
,
instead
of
individual
programmers
.
Second
,
it
suggests
that
for
building
a
code
unit
,
automated
unit
tests
be
written
first
before
the
actual
code
is
written
,
and
then
the
code
should
be
written
to
pass
the
tests
.
This
approach
is
referred
to
as
test-driven
development
,
in
contrast
to
regular
code-first
development
in
which
programmers
first
write
code
and
then
think
of
how
to
test
it
.
(
We
will
discuss
test-driven
development
further
in
Chapter
7
.
)
As
functionality
of
the
unit
increases
,
the
unit
tests
are
enhanced
first
,
and
then
the
code
is
enhanced
to
pass
the
new
set
of
unit
tests
.
Third
,
as
it
encourages
simple
solutions
as
well
as
change
,
it
is
expected
that
the
design
of
the
solution
devised
earlier
may
at
some
point
become
unsuitable
for
further
development
.
To
handle
this
situation
,
it
suggests
that
refactoring
be
done
to
improve
the
design
,
and
then
use
the
refactored
code
for
further
development
.
During
refactoring
,
no
new
functionality
is
added
,
only
the
design
of
the
existing
programs
is
improved
.
(
Refactoring
will
be
discussed
further
in
Chapter
7
.
)
Fourth
,
it
encourages
frequent
integration
of
different
units
.
To
avoid
too
many
changes
in
the
base
code
happening
together
,
only
one
pair
at
a
time
can
release
their
changes
and
integrate
into
the
common
code
base
.
The
process
within
an
iteration
is
shown
This
is
a
very
simplified
description
of
XP
.
There
are
many
other
rules
in
XP
relating
to
issues
like
rights
of
programmers
and
customers
,
communi-
cation
between
the
team
members
and
use
of
metaphors
,
trust
and
visibility
to
all
stakeholders
,
collective
ownership
of
code
in
which
any
pair
can
change
any

,
team
management
,
building
quick
spike
solutions
to
resolve
diffi-
cult
technical
and
architectural
issues
or
to
explore
some
approach
,
how
bugs
are
to
be
handled
,
how
what
can
be
done
within
an
iteration
is
to
be
esti-
mated
from
the
progress
made
in
the
previous
iteration
,
how
meetings
are
to
be
conducted
,
how
a
day
in
the
development
should
start
,
etc
.
The
website
is
a
good
source
on
these
,
as
well
as
other
as-
pects
of
XP
.
XP
,
and
other
agile
methods
,
are
suitable
for
situations
where
the
volume
and
pace
of
requirements
change
is
high
,
and
where
requirement
risks
are
con-
siderable
.
Because
of
its
reliance
on
strong
communication
between
all
the
team
members
,
it
is
effective
when
teams
are
collocated
and
of
modest
size
,
of
up
to
about
20
members
.
And
as
it
envisages
strong
involvement
of
the
customer
in
the
development
,
as
well
as
in
planning
the
delivery
dates
,
it
works
well
when
the
customer
is
willing
to
be
heavily
involved
during
the
entire
development
,
working
as
a
team
member
.
We
have
seen
many
different
development
process
models
.
What
is
the
need
for
the
different
models
?
As
mentioned
earlier
,
while
developing
(
industrial
strength
)
software
,
the
purpose
is
not
only
to
develop
software
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
some
users
or
clients
,
but
we
want
that
the
project
be
done
in
low
cost
and
cycle
time
,
and
deliver
high-quality
software
.
In
addition
,
there
could
be
other
constraints
in
a
project
that
the
project
may
need
to
satisfy
.
Hence
,
given
the
constraints
of
the
project
,
we
would
like
to
employ
the
process
model
that
is
likely
to
maximize
the
chances
of
delivering
the
software
,
and
achieve
the
highest
Q
&
P
.
Hence
,
selecting
a
suitable
development
process
model
for
a
project
is
a
key
decision
that
a
project
manager
has
to
take
.
Let
us
illustrate
this
by
a
few
examples
.
Suppose
a
small
team
of
developers
has
been
entrusted
with
the
task
of
building
a
small
auction
site
for
a
local
university
.
The
university
administration
is
willing
to
spend
some
time
at
the
start
to
help
develop
the
requirements
,
but
it
is
expected
that
their
availability
will
be
limited
later
.
The
team
has
been
given
,
and
an
extension
of
the
deadline
seems
very
improbable
.
It
also
seems
that
the
auction
site
will
have
some
features
that
are
essential
,
but
will
also
have
some
features
that
are
desirable
but
without
which
the
system
can
function
reasonably
well
.
With
these
constraints
,
it
is
clear
that
a
waterfall
model
is
not
suitable
for
this
project
,
as
the
“
all
or
nothing
”
risk
that
it
entails
is
unacceptable
due
to
the
inflexible
deadline
.
The
iterative
enhancement
model
where
each
iteration
does
a
complete
waterfall
is
also
not
right
as
it
requires
requirements
analysis
for
each
iteration
,
and
the
users
and
clients
are
not
available
later
.
However
,
the
iterative
delivery
approach
in
which
the
complete
requirements
are
done
in
the
first
iteration
but
delivery
is
done
in
iterations
seems
well
suited
,
with
delivery
being
done
in
two
(
or
three
)
iterations
(
as
time
is
short
)
.
From
the
requirements
,
the
project
team
can
decide
what
functionality
is
essential
to
have
in
a
working
system
and
include
it
in
the
first
iteration
.
The
other
desirable
features
can
be
planned
for
the
second
iteration
.
With
this
approach
,
the
chances
of
completing
the
first
iteration
before
the
final
deadline
increase
.
That
is
,
with
this
model
,
the
chances
of
delivering
a
working
system
increase
.
RUP
,
as
it
allows
iterations
in
each
phase
,
is
also
a
suitable
model
.
Consider
another
example
where
the
customers
are
in
a
highly
competitive
environment
where
requirements
depend
on
what
the
competition
is
doing
,
and
delivering
functionality
regularly
is
highly
desirable
.
Furthermore
,
to
reduce
cost
,
the
customer
wants
to
outsource
as
much
project
work
as
possible
to
another
team
in
another
country
.
For
this
project
,
clearly
waterfall
is
not
suitable
as
requirements
are
not
even
known
at
the
start
.
Iterative
enhancement
also
may
not
work
as
it
may
not
be
able
to
deliver
rapidly
.
XP
will
be
hard
to
apply
as
it
requires
that
the
entire
team
,
including
the
customer
,
be
collocated
.
For
this
project
,
the
timeboxing
model
seems
to
fit
the
best
.
The
whole
project
can
employ
three
teams—one
of
analysts
who
will
work
with
the
customer
to
determine
the
requirements
,
one
to
do
the
development
(
which
could
be
in
some
low-cost
destination
)
,
and
the
third
to
do
the
deployment
,
which
will
be
where
the
site
is
hosted
.
By
suitably
staffing
the
teams
,
the
duration
of
each
of
the
three
phases—analysis
and
design
,
build
,
and
deployment—can
be
made
approximately
equal
.
Then
Consider
another
project
,
where
a
university
wants
to
automate
the
reg-
istration
process
.
It
already
has
a
database
of
courses
and
pre-requisites
,
and
a
database
of
student
records
.
In
this
project
,
as
the
requirements
are
well
understood
(
since
registrations
have
been
happening
manually
)
,
the
waterfall
model
seems
to
be
the
optimum
.
While
the
selection
of
the
development
process
decides
the
phases
and
tasks
to
be
done
,
it
does
not
specify
things
like
how
long
each
phase
should
last
,
or
how
many
resources
should
be
assigned
to
a
phase
,
or
how
a
phase
should
be
monitored
.
And
quality
and
productivity
in
the
project
will
also
depend
critically
on
these
decisions
.
To
meet
the
cost
,
quality
,
and
schedule
objectives
,
resources
have
to
be
properly
allocated
to
each
activity
for
the
project
,
and
progress
of
different
activities
has
to
be
monitored
and
corrective
actions
taken
when
needed
.
All
these
activities
are
part
of
the
project
management
process
.
Hence
,
a
project
management
process
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
engineer-
ing
process
ends
up
meeting
the
real-world
objectives
of
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
.
The
project
management
process
specifies
all
activities
that
need
to
be
done
by
the
project
management
to
ensure
that
cost
and
quality
objectives
are
met
.
Its
basic
task
is
to
ensure
that
,
once
a
development
process
is
chosen
,
it
is
implemented
optimally
.
That
is
,
the
basic
task
is
to
plan
the
detailed
implementation
of
the
process
for
the
particular
project
and
then
ensure
that
the
plan
is
properly
executed
.
For
a
large
project
,
a
proper
management
process
is
essential
for
success
.
The
activities
in
the
management
process
for
a
project
can
be
grouped
broadly
into
three
phases
:
planning
,
monitoring
and
control
,
and
termination
analysis
.
Project
management
begins
with
planning
,
which
is
perhaps
the
most
critical
project
management
activity
.
The
goal
of
this
phase
is
to
develop
a
plan
for
software
development
following
which
the
objectives
of
the
project
can
be
met
successfully
and
efficiently
.
A
software
plan
is
usually
produced
before
the
development
activity
begins
and
is
updated
as
development
proceeds
and
data
about
progress
of
the
project
becomes
available
.
During
planning
,
the
major
activities
are
cost
estimation
,
schedule
and
milestone
determination
,
project
staffing
,
quality
control
plans
,
and
controlling
and
monitoring
plans
.
Project
planning
is
undoubtedly
the
single
most
important
management
activity
,
and
it
forms
the
basis
for
monitoring
and
control
.
We
will
devote
one
full
chapter
Project
monitoring
and
control
phase
of
the
management
process
is
the
longest
in
terms
of
duration
;
it
encompasses
most
of
the
development
process
.
It
includes
all
activities
the
project
management
has
to
perform
while
the
development
is
going
on
to
ensure
that
project
objectives
are
met
and
the
development
proceeds
according
to
the
developed
plan
(
and
update
the
plan
,
if
needed
)
.
As
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
are
the
major
driving
forces
,
most
of
the
activity
of
this
phase
revolves
around
monitoring
factors
that
affect
these
.
Monitoring
potential
risks
for
the
project
,
which
might
prevent
the
project
from
meeting
its
objectives
,
is
another
important
activity
during
this
phase
.
And
if
the
information
obtained
by
monitoring
suggests
that
objectives
may
not
be
met
,
necessary
actions
are
taken
in
this
phase
by
exerting
suitable
control
on
the
development
activities
.
Monitoring
a
development
process
requires
proper
information
about
the
project
.
Such
information
is
typically
obtained
by
the
management
process
from
the
development
process
.
Consequently
,
the
implementation
of
a
development
process
model
should
ensure
that
each
step
in
the
development
process
produces
information
that
the
management
process
needs
for
that
step
.
That
is
,
the
development
process
provides
the
information
the
management
process
needs
.
However
,
interpretation
of
the
information
is
part
of
monitoring
and
control
.
Whereas
monitoring
and
control
last
the
entire
duration
of
the
project
,
the
last
phase
of
the
management
process—termination
analysis—is
performed
when
the
development
process
is
over
.
The
basic
reason
for
performing
termi-
nation
analysis
is
to
provide
information
about
the
development
process
and
learn
from
the
project
in
order
to
improve
the
process
.
This
phase
is
also
of-
ten
called
postmortem
analysis
.
In
iterative
development
,
this
analysis
can
be
done
after
each
iteration
to
provide
feedback
to
improve
the
execution
of
fur-
ther
iterations
.
We
will
not
discuss
it
further
in
the
book
;
for
an
example
of
a
postmortem
report
the
reader
is
referred
to
[
57
]
.
The
temporal
relationship
between
the
management
process
and
the
devel-
opment
process
is
shown
in
Figure
This
is
an
idealized
relationship
show-
ing
that
planning
is
done
before
development
begins
,
and
termination
analysis
is
done
after
development
is
over
.
As
the
figure
shows
,
during
the
development
,
from
the
various
phases
of
the
development
process
,
quantitative
information
flows
to
the
monitoring
and
control
phase
of
the
management
process
,
which
uses
the
information
to
exert
control
on
the
development
process
.
We
will
in
a
later
chapter
discuss
in
detail
the
project
planning
phase
.
As
a
plan
also
includes
planning
for
monitoring
,
we
will
not
discuss
the
monitoring
separately
but
discuss
it
as
part
of
the
planning
activity
.

The
quality
and
productivity
achieved
in
a
software
project
depends
on
the
process
used
for
executing
the
project
.
Due
to
this
,
processes
form
the
heart
of
software
engineering
.
A
process
is
the
set
of
activities
that
are
performed
in
some
order
so
that
the
desired
results
will
be
achieved
.
A
process
model
is
a
general
process
specification
which
has
been
found
to
be
best
suited
for
some
situations
.
A
software
process
consists
of
many
different
component
processes
,
most
im-
portant
being
the
development
process
and
the
project
management
process
.
Development
process
focuses
on
how
the
software
is
to
be
engineered
.
There
are
many
different
process
models
,
each
being
well
suited
for
some
type
of
problems
.
The
waterfall
model
is
conceptually
the
simplest
model
of
software
de-
velopment
,
where
the
requirement
,
design
,
coding
,
and
testing
phases
are
performed
in
linear
progression
.
It
has
been
very
widely
used
,
and
is
suit-
able
for
well-understood
problems
.
In
the
prototyping
model
,
a
prototype
is
built
before
building
the
final
system
,
which
is
used
to
further
develop
the
requirements
leading
to
more
stable
requirements
.
This
is
useful
for
projects
where
requirements
are
not
clear
.
In
the
iterative
development
model
,
software
is
developed
in
iterations
,
each
iteration
resulting
in
a
working
software
system
.
This
model
does
not
require
all
requirements
to
be
known
at
the
start
,
allows
feedback
from
earlier
iterations
for
next
ones
,
and
reduces
risk
as
it
delivers
value
as
the
project
proceeds
.
In
RUP
,
a
project
is
executed
in
a
sequence
of
four
phases—inception
,
elab-
oration
,
construction
,
and
transition
,
each
ending
in
a
defined
milestone
.
A
phase
may
itself
be
done
iteratively
.
The
subprocesses
of
requirements
,
de-
sign
,
coding
,
testing
,
etc
.
are
considered
as
active
throughout
the
project
,
though
their
intensity
varies
from
phase
to
phase
.
RUP
is
a
flexible
frame-
work
which
can
allow
a
project
to
follow
a
traditional
waterfall
if
it
wants
to
,
or
allow
prototyping
,
if
it
so
wishes
.
In
the
timeboxing
model
,
the
different
iterations
are
of
equal
time
duration
,
and
are
divided
into
equal
length
stages
.
There
is
a
committed
team
for
each
stage
of
an
iteration
.
The
different
iterations
are
then
executed
in
a
pipelined
manner
,
with
each
dedicated
team
working
on
its
stage
but
for
different
iterations
.
As
multiple
iterations
are
concurrently
active
,
this
model
reduces
the
average
completion
time
of
each
iteration
and
hence
is
useful
in
situations
where
short
cycle
time
is
highly
desirable
.
Agile
approaches
to
development
are
based
on
some
key
principles
like
developing
software
in
small
iterations
,
working
system
as
the
measure
of
progress
,
and
allowing
change
at
any
time
.
In
extreme
programming
(
XP
)
approach
,
a
project
starts
with
short
user
stories
,
details
of
which
are
obtained
in
the
iteration
in
which
they
are
implemented
.
In
an
iteration
,
development
is
done
by
programmer-pairs
,
following
the
practices
of
test-
driven
development
,
frequent
integration
,
and
having
simple
designs
which
are
refactored
when
needed
.
The
project
management
process
focuses
on
planning
and
controlling
the
de-
velopment
process
and
consists
of
three
major
phases—planning
,
monitoring
and
control
,
and
termination
analysis
.
Much
of
project
management
revolves
around
the
project
plan
,
which
is
produced
during
the
planning
phase
.
What
is
the
relationship
between
a
process
model
,
process
specification
,
and
process
for
a
project
?
What
are
the
key
outputs
during
an
iteration
in
a
project
following
an
iterative
development
model
?
Which
of
the
development
process
models
discussed
in
this
chapter
would
you
employ
for
the
following
projects
?
A
data
entry
system
for
office
staff
who
have
never
used
computers
before
.
The
user
interface
and
user-friendliness
are
extremely
important
.
A
spreadsheet
system
that
has
some
basic
features
and
many
other
desirable
features
that
use
these
basic
features
.
A
web-based
system
for
a
new
business
where
requirements
are
changing
fast
and
where
an
in-house
development
team
is
available
for
all
aspects
of
the
project
.
A
Web-site
for
an
on-line
store
which
has
a
long
list
of
desired
features
it
wants
to
add
,
and
it
wants
a
new
release
with
new
features
to
be
done
very
frequently
.
A
project
uses
the
timeboxing
process
model
with
three
stages
in
each
time
box
(
as
discussed
in
the
chapter
)
,
but
with
unequal
length
.
Suppose
the
requirement
specification
stage
takes
,
the
build
stage
takes
,
and
deployment
takes
.
Design
the
process
for
this
project
that
maximizes
resource
utilization
.
Assume
that
each
resource
can
do
any
task
.
(
Hint
:
Exploit
the
fact
that
the
sum
of
durations
of
the
first
and
the
third
stage
is
equal
to
the
duration
of
the
second
stage
.

What
effect
is
the
project
monitoring
activity
likely
to
have
on
the
development
process
?
IEEE
defines
a
requirement
as
“
(

A
condition
of

needed
by
a

to
solve
a

,

Note
that
in
software
requirements
we
are
dealing
with
the
requirements
of
the
proposed
system
,
that
is
,
the
capabilities
that
the
system
,
which
is
yet
to
be
developed
,
should
have
.
As
we
have
seen
,
all
development
models
require
requirements
to
be
speci-
fied
.
Approaches
like
agile
require
only
high-level
requirements
to
be
specified
in
written
form—detailed
requirements
are
elicited
through
interaction
with
the
customer
in
the
iteration
the
requirement
is
to
be
implemented
and
di-
rectly
reflected
in
software
.
Other
approaches
prefer
that
the
requirements
are
specified
precisely
.
In
such
situations
,
the
goal
of
the
requirements
activity
is
to
produce
the
Software
Requirements
Specification
(
SRS
)
that
describes
what
the
proposed
software
should
do

A
Concise
Introduction
to
Software
Engineering
,
The
use
case
approach
for
analyzing
and
specifying
functional
requirements
,
and
how
use
cases
can
be
developed
.
Some
other
approaches
for
analyzing
requirements
like
the
data
flow
diagram
.
The
origin
of
most
software
systems
is
in
the
needs
of
some
clients
.
The
software
system
itself
is
created
by
some
developers
.
Finally
,
the
completed
system
will
be
used
by
the
end
users
.
Thus
,
there
are
three
major
parties
interested
in
a
new
system
:
the
client
,
the
developer
,
and
the
users
.
Somehow
the
requirements
for
the
system
that
will
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
clients
and
the
concerns
of
the
users
have
to
be
communicated
to
the
developer
.
The
problem
is
that
the
client
usually
does
not
understand
software
or
the
software
development
process
,
and
the
developer
often
does
not
understand
the
client
’
s
problem
and
application
area
.
This
causes
a
communication
gap
between
the
parties
involved
in
the
de-
velopment
project
.
A
basic
purpose
of
the
SRS
is
to
bridge
this
communication
gap
so
they
have
a
shared
vision
of
the
software
being
built
.
Hence
,
one
of
the
main
advantages
of
a
good
SRS
is
:
An
SRS
establishes
the
basis
for
agreement
between
the
client
and
the
sup-
plier
on
what
the
software
product
will
do
.
This
basis
for
agreement
is
frequently
formalized
into
a
legal
contract
between
the
client
(
or
the
customer
)
and
the
developer
(
the
supplier
)
.
So
,
through
SRS
,
the
client
clearly
describes
what
it
expects
from
the
supplier
,
and
the
developer
clearly
understands
what
capabilities
to
build
in
the
software
.
A
related
,
but
important
,
advantage
is
:
An
SRS
provides
a
reference
for
validation
of
the
final
product
.
That
is
,
the
SRS
helps
the
client
determine
if
the
software
meets
the
require-
ments
.
Without
a
proper
SRS
,
there
is
no
way
a
client
can
determine
if
the
software
being
delivered
is
what
was
ordered
,
and
there
is
no
way
the
developer
can
convince
the
client
that
all
the
requirements
have
been
fulfilled
.
Providing
the
basis
of
agreement
and
validation
should
be
strong
enough
reasons
for
both
the
client
and
the
developer
to
do
a
thorough
and
rigorous
job
of
requirement
understanding
and
specification
,
but
there
are
other
very
practical
and
pressing
reasons
for
having
a
good
SRS
.
Studies
have
shown
that
many
errors
are
made
during
the
requirements
phase
.
And
an
error
in
the
SRS
will
manifest
itself
as
an
error
in
the
final
system
implementing
the
SRS
.
Clearly
,
if
we
want
a
high-quality
end
product
that
has
few
errors
,
we
must
begin
with
a
high-quality
SRS
.
In
other
words
,
we
can
conclude
that
:
A
high-quality
SRS
is
a
prerequisite
to
high-quality
software
.
Finally
,
the
quality
of
SRS
has
an
impact
on
cost
(
and
schedule
)
of
the
project
.
We
know
that
errors
can
exist
in
the
SRS
.
It
is
also
known
that
the
cost
of
fixing
an
error
increases
almost
exponentially
as
time
progresses
[
10
,
12
]
.
Hence
,
by
improving
the
quality
of
requirements
,
we
can
have
a
huge
savings
in
the
future
by
having
fewer
expensive
defect
removals
.
In
other
words
,
The
requirement
process
is
the
sequence
of
activities
that
need
to
be
performed
in
the
requirements
phase
and
that
culminate
in
producing
a
high-quality
doc-
ument
containing
the
SRS
.
The
requirements
process
typically
consists
of
three
basic
tasks
:
problem
or
requirement
analysis
,
requirements
specification
,
and
requirements
validation
.
Problem
analysis
often
starts
with
a
high-level
“
problem
statement.
”
Dur-
ing
analysis
the
problem
domain
and
the
environment
are
modeled
in
an
effort
to
understand
the
system
behavior
,
constraints
on
the
system
,
its
inputs
and
outputs
,
etc
.
The
basic
purpose
of
this
activity
is
to
obtain
a
thorough
under-
standing
of
what
the
software
needs
to
provide
.
Frequently
,
during
analysis
,
the
analyst
will
have
a
series
of
meetings
with
the
clients
and
end
users
.
In
the
early
meetings
,
the
clients
and
end
users
will
explain
to
the
analyst
about
their
work
,
their
environment
,
and
their
needs
as
they
perceive
them
.
Any
documents
de-
scribing
the
work
or
the
organization
may
be
given
,
along
with
outputs
of
the
existing
methods
of
performing
the
tasks
.
In
these
early
meetings
,
the
analyst
is
basically
the
listener
,
absorbing
the
information
provided
.
Once
the
analyst
understands
the
system
to
some
extent
,
he
uses
the
next
few
meetings
to
seek
clarifications
of
the
parts
he
does
not
understand
.
He
may
document
the
infor-
mation
or
build
some
models
,
and
he
may
do
some
brainstorming
or
thinking
about
what
the
system
should
do
.
In
the
final
few
meetings
,
the
analyst
essen-
tially
explains
to
the
client
what
he
understands
the
system
should
do
and
uses
the
meetings
as
a
means
of
verifying
if
what
he
proposes
the
system
should
do
is
indeed
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
the
clients
.
The
understanding
obtained
by
problem
analysis
forms
the
basis
of
require-
ments
specification
,
in
which
the
focus
is
on
clearly
specifying
the
requirements
in
a
document
.
Issues
such
as
representation
,
specification
languages
,
and
tools
are
addressed
during
this
activity
.
As
analysis
produces
large
amounts
of
in-
formation
and
knowledge
with
possible
redundancies
,
properly
organizing
and
describing
the
requirements
is
an
important
goal
of
this
activity
.
Requirements
validation
focuses
on
ensuring
that
what
have
been
specified
in
the
SRS
are
indeed
all
the
requirements
of
the
software
and
making
sure
that
the
SRS
is
of
good
quality
.
The
requirements
process
terminates
with
the
production
of
the
validated
SRS
.
We
will
discuss
this
more
later
in
the
chapter
.
It
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
requirements
process
is
not
a
linear
se-
quence
of
these
three
activities
and
there
is
considerable
overlap
and
feedback
between
these
activities
.
The
overall
requirement
process
is
shown
in
Figure
As
shown
in
the
figure
,
from
the
specification
activity
we
may
go
back
to
the
analysis
activity
.
This
happens
as
frequently
some
parts
of
the
problem
are
analyzed
and
then
specified
before
other
parts
are
analyzed
and
speci-
fied
.
Furthermore
,
the
process
of
specification
frequently
shows
shortcomings
in
the
knowledge
of
the
problem
,
thereby
necessitating
further
analysis
.
Once
the
specification
is
done
,
it
goes
through
the
validation
activity
.
This
activity
may
reveal
problems
in
the
specification
itself
,
which
requires
going
back
to
the
specification
step
,
or
may
reveal
shortcomings
in
the
understanding
of
the
problem
,
which
requires
going
back
to
the
analysis
activity
.
The
final
output
is
the
SRS
document
.
As
analysis
precedes
specification
,
the
first
question
that
arises
is
:
If
formal
modeling
is
done
during
analysis
,
why
are
the
outputs
of
modeling
not
treated
as
an
SRS
?
The
main
reason
is
that
modeling
generally
focuses
on
the
problem
structure
,
not
its
external
behavior
.
Consequently
,
things
like
user
interfaces
are
rarely
modeled
,
whereas
they
fre-
quently
form
a
major
component
of
the
SRS
.
Similarly
,
for
ease
of
modeling
,
frequently
“
minor
issues
”
like
erroneous
situations
(
e.g.
,
error
in
output
)
are
rarely
modeled
properly
,
whereas
in
an
SRS
,
behavior
under
such
situations
also
has
to
be
specified
.
Similarly
,
performance
constraints
,
design
constraints
,
standards
compliance
,
recovery
,
etc.
,
are
not
included
in
the
model
,
but
must
be
specified
clearly
in
the
SRS
because
the
designer
must
know
about
these
to
properly
design
the
system
.
It
should
therefore
be
clear
that
the
outputs
of
a
model
can
not
form
a
desirable
SRS
.
The
transition
from
analysis
to
specification
should
also
not
be
expected
to
be
straightforward
,
even
if
some
formal
modeling
is
used
during
analysis
.
A
good
SRS
needs
to
specify
many
things
,
some
of
which
are
not
satisfactorily
handled
during
analysis
.
Essentially
,
what
passes
from
requirements
analysis
activity
to
the
specification
activity
is
the
knowledge
acquired
about
the
sys-
tem
.
The
modeling
is
essentially
a
tool
to
help
obtain
a
thorough
and
com-
plete
knowledge
about
the
proposed
system
.
The
SRS
is
written
based
on
the
knowledge
acquired
during
analysis
.
As
converting
knowledge
into
a
structured
document
is
not
straightforward
,
specification
itself
is
a
major
task
,
which
is
relatively
independent
.
To
properly
satisfy
the
basic
goals
,
an
SRS
should
have
certain
properties
and
should
contain
different
types
of
requirements
.
Some
of
the
desirable
charac-
teristics
of
an
SRS
are
[
53
]
:
An
SRS
is
correct
if
every
requirement
included
in
the
SRS
represents
something
required
in
the
final
system
.
It
is
complete
if
everything
the
software
is
supposed
to
do
and
the
responses
of
the
software
to
all
classes
of
input
data
are
specified
in
the
SRS
.
It
is
unambiguous
if
and
only
if
every
requirement
stated
has
one
and
only
one
interpretation
.
Requirements
are
often
written
in
natural
language
,
which
is
inherently
ambiguous
.
If
the
requirements
are
specified
in
a
natural
language
,
the
SRS
writer
has
to
be
especially
careful
to
ensure
that
there
are
no
ambiguities
.
An
SRS
is
verifiable
if
and
only
if
every
stated
requirement
is
verifiable
.
A
requirement
is
verifiable
if
there
exists
some
cost-effective
process
that
can
check
whether
the
final
software
meets
that
requirement
.
It
is
consistent
if
there
is
no
requirement
that
conflicts
with
another
.
Terminology
can
cause
inconsistencies
;
for
example
,
different
requirements
may
use
different
terms
to
refer
to
the
same
object
.
There
may
be
logical
or
temporal
conflict
between
requirements
that
causes
inconsistencies
.
This
occurs
if
the
SRS
contains
two
or
more
requirements
whose
logical
or
temporal
characteristics
can
not
be
satisfied
together
by
any
software
system
.
For
example
,
suppose
a
requirement
states
that
an
event
e
is
to
occur
before
another
event
f
.
But
then
another
set
of
requirements
states
(
directly
or
indirectly
by
transitivity
)
that
event
f
should
occur
before
event
e.
Inconsistencies
in
an
SRS
can
reflect
some
major
problems
.
Generally
,
all
the
requirements
for
software
are
not
of
equal
importance
.
Some
are
critical
,
others
are
important
but
not
critical
,
and
there
are
some
which
are
desirable
but
not
very
important
.
Similarly
,
some
requirements
are
“
core
”
requirements
which
are
not
likely
to
change
as
time
passes
,
while
others
are
more
dependent
on
time
.
Some
provide
more
value
to
the
users
than
oth-
ers
.
An
SRS
is
ranked
for
importance
and/or
stability
if
for
each
requirement
the
importance
and
the
stability
of
the
requirement
are
indicated
.
Stability
of
a
requirement
reflects
the
chances
of
it
changing
in
the
future
.
It
can
be
reflected
in
terms
of
the
expected
change
volume
.
This
understanding
of
value
each
requirement
provides
is
essential
for
iterative
development—selection
of
requirements
for
an
iteration
is
based
on
this
evaluation
.
Of
all
these
characteristics
,
completeness
is
perhaps
the
most
important
and
also
the
most
difficult
property
to
establish
.
One
of
the
most
common
defects
in
requirements
specification
is
incompleteness
.
Missing
requirements
necessitate
additions
and
modifications
to
the
requirements
later
in
the
development
cycle
,
which
are
often
expensive
to
incorporate
.
Incompleteness
is
also
a
major
source
of
disagreement
between
the
client
and
the
supplier
.
Some
,
however
,
believe
that
completeness
in
all
details
may
not
be
desirable
.
The
pursuit
of
completeness
can
lead
to
specifying
details
and
assumptions
that
may
be
commonly
understood
.
(
For
example
,
specifying
in
detail
what
a
common
operation
like
add
a
record
means
.
)
And
specifying
these
details
can
result
in
a
large
requirements
document
,
which
has
its
own
problems
including
making
validation
harder
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
too
few
details
are
given
,
the
chances
of
developer
’
s
understanding
being
different
from
others
’
increases
,
which
can
lead
to
defects
in
the
software
.
For
completeness
,
a
reasonable
goal
is
to
have
“
sufficient
detail
”
for
the
project
at
hand
.
For
example
,
if
the
waterfall
model
is
to
be
followed
in
the
project
,
it
is
better
to
have
detailed
specifications
so
the
need
for
changes
is
minimized
.
On
the
other
hand
,
for
iterative
development
,
as
feedback
is
possible
and
opportunity
for
change
is
also
there
,
the
specification
can
be
less
detailed
.
And
if
an
agile
approach
is
being
followed
,
then
completeness
should
be
sought
only
for
top-level
requirements
,
as
details
may
not
be
required
in
written
form
,
and
are
elicited
when
the
requirement
is
being
implemented
.
Together
the
performance
and
interface
requirements
and
design
constraints
can
be
called
nonfunctional
requirements
.
Completeness
of
specifications
is
difficult
to
achieve
and
even
more
difficult
to
verify
.
Having
guidelines
about
what
different
things
an
SRS
should
specify
will
help
in
completely
specifying
the
requirements
.
The
basic
issues
an
SRS
must
address
are
:
Functional
requirements
specify
the
expected
behavior
of
the
system—which
outputs
should
be
produced
from
the
given
inputs
.
They
describe
the
relation-
ship
between
the
input
and
output
of
the
system
.
For
each
functional
require-
ment
,
a
detailed
description
of
all
the
data
inputs
and
their
source
,
the
units
of
measure
,
and
the
range
of
valid
inputs
must
be
specified
.
All
the
operations
to
be
performed
on
the
input
data
to
obtain
the
output
should
be
specified
.
This
includes
specifying
the
validity
checks
on
the
input
and
output
data
,
parameters
affected
by
the
operation
,
and
equations
or
other
logical
operations
that
must
be
used
to
transform
the
inputs
into
corresponding
outputs
.
For
example
,
if
there
is
a
formula
for
computing
the
output
,
it
should
be
specified
.
An
important
part
of
the
specification
is
the
system
behavior
in
abnormal
situations
,
like
invalid
input
(
which
can
occur
in
many
ways
)
or
error
during
computation
.
The
functional
requirement
must
clearly
state
what
the
system
should
do
if
such
situations
occur
.
Specifically
,
it
should
specify
the
behavior
of
the
system
for
invalid
inputs
and
invalid
outputs
.
Furthermore
,
behavior
for
situations
where
the
input
is
valid
but
the
normal
operation
can
not
be
performed
should
also
be
specified
.
An
example
of
this
situation
is
a
reservation
system
,
where
a
reservation
can
not
be
made
even
for
a
valid
request
if
there
is
no
availability
.
In
short
,
the
system
behavior
for
all
foreseen
inputs
and
all
foreseen
system
states
should
be
specified
.
The
performance
requirements
part
of
an
SRS
specifies
the
performance
constraints
on
the
software
system
.
All
the
requirements
relating
to
the
per-
formance
characteristics
of
the
system
must
be
clearly
specified
.
There
are
two
types
of
performance
requirements
:
static
and
dynamic
.
Static
requirements
are
those
that
do
not
impose
constraint
on
the
execution
characteristics
of
the
system
.
These
include
requirements
like
the
number
of
terminals
to
be
supported
,
the
number
of
simultaneous
users
to
be
supported
,
and
the
number
of
files
that
the
system
has
to
process
and
their
sizes
.
These
are
also
called
capacity
requirements
of
the
system
.
Dynamic
requirements
specify
constraints
on
the
execution
behavior
of
the
system
.
These
typically
include
response
time
and
throughput
constraints
on
the
system
.
Response
time
is
the
expected
time
for
the
completion
of
an
op-
eration
under
specified
circumstances
.
Throughput
is
the
expected
number
of
operations
that
can
be
performed
in
a
unit
time
.
For
example
,
the
SRS
may
specify
the
number
of
transactions
that
must
be
processed
per
unit
time
,
or
what
the
response
time
for
a
particular
command
should
be
.
Acceptable
ranges
of
the
different
performance
parameters
should
be
specified
,
as
well
as
accept-
able
performance
for
both
normal
and
peak
workload
conditions
.
All
of
these
requirements
should
be
stated
in
measurable
terms
.
Require-
ments
such
as
“
response
time
should
be
good
”
or
the
system
must
be
able
to
“
process
all
the
transactions
quickly
”
are
not
desirable
because
they
are
impre-
cise
and
not
verifiable
.
Instead
,
statements
like
“
the
response
time
of
command
x
should
be
less
than
one
second
90
%
of
the
times
”
or
“
a
transaction
should
be
processed
in
less
than
one
second
98
%
of
the
times
”
should
be
used
to
declare
performance
specifications
.
There
are
a
number
of
factors
in
the
client
’
s
environment
that
may
restrict
the
choices
of
a
designer
leading
to
design
constraints
.
Such
factors
include
standards
that
must
be
followed
,
resource
limits
,
operating
environment
,
relia-
bility
and
security
requirements
,
and
policies
that
may
have
an
impact
on
the
design
of
the
system
.
An
SRS
should
identify
and
specify
all
such
constraints
.
Some
examples
of
these
are
:
Standards
Compliance
:
This
specifies
the
requirements
for
the
standards
the
system
must
follow
.
The
standards
may
include
the
report
format
and
accounting
procedures
.
There
may
be
audit
requirements
which
may
require
logging
of
operations
.
Hardware
Limitations
:
The
software
may
have
to
operate
on
some
ex-
isting
or
predetermined
hardware
,
thus
imposing
restrictions
on
the
design
.
Hardware
limitations
can
include
the
type
of
machines
to
be
used
,
operating
system
available
on
the
system
,
languages
supported
,
and
limits
on
primary
and
secondary
storage
.
Reliability
and
Fault
Tolerance
:
Fault
tolerance
requirements
can
place
a
major
constraint
on
how
the
system
is
to
be
designed
,
as
they
make
the
system
more
complex
and
expensive
.
Recovery
requirements
are
often
an
integral
part
here
,
detailing
what
the
system
should
do
if
some
failure
occurs
to
ensure
certain
properties
.
Security
:
Security
requirements
are
becoming
increasingly
important
.
These
requirements
place
restrictions
on
the
use
of
certain
commands
,
control
access
to
data
,
provide
different
kinds
of
access
requirements
for
different
people
,
re-
quire
the
use
of
passwords
and
cryptography
techniques
,
and
maintain
a
log
of
activities
in
the
system
.
They
may
also
require
proper
assessment
of
security
threats
,
proper
programming
techniques
,
and
use
of
tools
to
detect
flaws
like
buffer
overflow
.
In
the
external
interface
specification
part
,
all
the
interactions
of
the
soft-
ware
with
people
,
hardware
,
and
other
software
should
be
clearly
specified
.
For
the
user
interface
,
the
characteristics
of
each
user
interface
of
the
software
prod-
uct
should
be
specified
.
User
interface
is
becoming
increasingly
important
and
must
be
given
proper
attention
.
A
preliminary
user
manual
should
be
created
with
all
user
commands
,
screen
formats
,
an
explanation
of
how
the
system
will
appear
to
the
user
,
and
feedback
and
error
messages
.
Like
other
specifications
,
these
requirements
should
be
precise
and
verifiable
.
So
,
a
statement
like
“
the
system
should
be
user
friendly
”
should
be
avoided
and
statements
like
“
com-
mands
should
be
no
longer
than
six
characters
”
or
“
command
names
should
reflect
the
function
they
perform
”
used
.
For
hardware
interface
requirements
,
the
SRS
should
specify
the
logical
characteristics
of
each
interface
between
the
software
product
and
the
hard-
ware
components
.
If
the
software
is
to
execute
on
existing
hardware
or
on
pre-
determined
hardware
,
all
the
characteristics
of
the
hardware
,
including
memory
restrictions
,
should
be
specified
.
In
addition
,
the
current
use
and
load
charac-
teristics
of
the
hardware
should
be
given
.
The
interface
requirement
should
specify
the
interface
with
other
software
the
system
will
use
or
that
will
use
the
system
.
This
includes
the
interface
with
the
operating
system
and
other
applications
.
The
message
content
and
format
of
each
interface
should
be
specified
.
Requirements
have
to
be
specified
using
some
specification
language
.
Though
formal
notations
exist
for
specifying
specific
properties
of
the
system
,
natural
languages
are
now
most
often
used
for
specifying
requirements
.
When
formal
languages
are
employed
,
they
are
often
used
to
specify
particular
properties
or
for
specific
parts
of
the
system
,
as
part
of
the
overall
SRS
.
All
the
requirements
for
a
system
,
stated
using
a
formal
notation
or
natural
language
,
have
to
be
included
in
a
document
that
is
clear
and
concise
.
For
this
,
it
is
necessary
to
properly
organize
the
requirements
document
.
Here
we
discuss
the
organization
based
on
the
IEEE
guide
to
software
requirements
specifications
[
53
]
.
The
IEEE
standards
recognize
the
fact
that
different
projects
may
require
their
requirements
to
be
organized
differently
,
that
is
,
there
is
no
one
method
that
is
suitable
for
all
projects
.
It
provides
different
ways
of
structuring
the
SRS
.
The
first
two
sections
of
the
SRS
are
the
same
in
all
of
them
.
The
general
structure
of
an
SRS
is
given
in
Figure
The
introduction
section
contains
the
purpose
,
scope
,
overview
,
etc.
,
of
the
requirements
document
.
The
key
aspect
here
is
to
clarify
the
motivation
and
business
objectives
that
are
driving
this
project
,
and
the
scope
of
the
project
.
The
next
section
gives
an
overall
perspective
of
the
system—how
it
fits
into
the
larger
system
,
and
an
overview
of
all
the
requirements
of
this
system
.
Detailed
requirements
are
not
mentioned
.
Product
perspective
is
essentially
the
relationship
of
the
product
to
other
products
;
defining
if
the
product
is
independent
or
is
a
part
of
a
larger
product
,
and
what
the
principal
interfaces
of
the
product
are
.
A
general
abstract
description
of
the
functions
to
be
performed
by
the
product
is
given
.
Schematic
diagrams
showing
a
general
view
of
different
functions
and
their
relationships
with
each
other
can
often
be
useful
.
Similarly
,
typical
characteristics
of
the
eventual
end
user
and
general
constraints
are
also
specified
.
If
agile
methods
are
being
used
,
this
may
be
sufficient
for
the
initial
require-
ments
phase
,
as
these
approaches
prefer
to
do
the
detailed
requirements
when
the
requirement
is
to
be
implemented
.
The
detailed
requirements
section
describes
the
details
of
the
requirements
that
a
developer
needs
to
know
for
designing
and
developing
the
system
.
This
is
typically
the
largest
and
most
important
part
of
the
document
.
For
this
section
,
different
organizations
have
been
suggested
in
the
standard
.
These
re-
quirements
can
be
organized
by
the
modes
of
operation
,
user
class
,
object
,
feature
,
stimulus
,
or
functional
hierarchy
[
53
]
.
One
method
to
organize
the
spe-
cific
requirements
is
to
first
specify
the
external
interfaces
,
followed
by
func-
tional
requirements
,
performance
requirements
,
design
constraints
,
and
system
attributes
.
This
structure
is
shown
in
Figure
[
53
]
.
The
external
interface
requirements
section
specifies
all
the
interfaces
of
the
software
:
to
people
,
other
software
,
hardware
,
and
other
systems
.
User
interfaces
are
clearly
a
very
important
component
;
they
specify
each
human
interface
the
system
plans
to
have
,
including
screen
formats
,
contents
of
menus
,
and
command
structure
.
In
hardware
interfaces
,
the
logical
characteristics
of
each
interface
between
the
software
and
hardware
on
which
the
software
can
run
are
specified
.
Essentially
,
any
assumptions
the
software
is
making
about
the
hardware
are
listed
here
.
In
software
interfaces
,
all
other
software
that
is
needed
for
this
software
to
run
is
specified
,
along
with
the
interfaces
.
Communication
interfaces
need
to
be
specified
if
the
software
communicates
with
other
entities
in
other
machines
.
In
the
functional
requirements
section
,
the
functional
capabilities
of
the
system
are
described
.
In
this
organization
,
the
functional
capabilities
for
all
the
modes
of
operation
of
the
software
are
given
.
For
each
functional
requirement
,
the
required
inputs
,
desired
outputs
,
and
processing
requirements
will
have
to
be
specified
.
For
the
inputs
,
the
source
of
the
inputs
,
the
units
of
measure
,
valid
ranges
,
accuracies
,
etc.
,
have
to
be
specified
.
For
specifying
the
processing
,
all
operations
that
need
to
be
performed
on
the
input
data
and
any
intermediate
data
produced
should
be
specified
.
This
includes
validity
checks
on
inputs
,
sequence
of
operations
,
responses
to
abnormal
situations
,
and
methods
that
must
be
used
in
processing
to
transform
the
inputs
into
corresponding
outputs
.
The
performance
section
should
specify
both
static
and
dynamic
perfor-
mance
requirements
.
All
factors
that
constrain
the
system
design
are
described
in
the
performance
constraints
section
.
The
attributes
section
specifies
some
of
the
overall
attributes
that
the
system
should
have
.
Any
requirement
not
covered
under
these
is
listed
under
other
requirements
.
Design
constraints
specify
all
the
constraints
imposed
on
design
(
e.g.
,
security
,
fault
tolerance
,
and
standards
When
use
cases
are
employed
,
then
the
functional
requirements
section
of
the
SRS
is
replaced
by
use
case
descriptions
.
And
the
product
perspective
part
of
the
SRS
may
provide
an
overview
or
summary
of
the
use
cases
.
Functional
requirements
often
form
the
core
of
a
requirements
document
.
The
traditional
approach
for
specifying
functionality
is
to
specify
each
function
that
the
system
should
provide
.
Use
cases
specify
the
functionality
of
a
system
by
specifying
the
behavior
of
the
system
,
captured
as
interactions
of
the
users
with
the
system
.
Use
cases
can
be
used
to
describe
the
business
processes
of
the
larger
business
or
organization
that
deploys
the
software
,
or
it
could
just
describe
the
behavior
of
the
software
system
.
We
will
focus
on
describing
the
behavior
of
software
systems
that
are
to
be
built
.
Though
use
cases
are
primarily
for
specifying
behavior
,
they
can
also
be
used
effectively
for
analysis
.
Later
when
we
discuss
how
to
develop
use
cases
,
we
will
discuss
how
they
can
help
in
eliciting
requirements
also
.
Use
cases
drew
attention
after
they
were
used
as
part
of
the
object-oriented
modeling
approach
proposed
by
Jacobson
[
56
]
.
Due
to
this
connection
with
an
object-oriented
approach
,
use
cases
are
sometimes
viewed
as
part
of
an
object-oriented
approach
to
software
development
.
However
,
they
are
a
general
method
for
describing
the
interaction
of
a
system
(
even
non-IT
systems
)
.
The
discussion
of
use
cases
here
is
based
on
the
concepts
and
processes
discussed
in
[
24
]
.
A
software
system
(
in
our
case
whose
requirements
are
being
uncovered
)
may
be
used
by
many
users
,
or
by
other
systems
.
In
use
case
terminology
,
an
actor
is
a
person
or
a
system
which
uses
the
system
for
achieving
some
goal
.
Note
that
as
an
actor
interacts
for
achieving
some
goal
,
it
is
a
logical
entity
that
represents
a
group
of
users
(
people
or
system
)
who
behave
in
a
similar
manner
.
Different
actors
represent
groups
with
different
goals
.
So
,
it
is
better
to
have
a
“
receiver
”
and
a
“
sender
”
actor
rather
than
having
a
generic
“
user
”
actor
for
a
system
in
which
some
messages
are
sent
by
users
and
received
by
some
other
users
.
A
primary
actor
is
the
main
actor
that
initiates
a
use
case
(
UC
)
for
achieving
a
goal
,
and
whose
goal
satisfaction
is
the
main
objective
of
the
use
case
.
The
primary
actor
is
a
logical
concept
and
though
we
assume
that
the
primary
actor
executes
the
use
case
,
some
agent
may
actually
execute
it
on
behalf
of
the
primary
actor
.
For
example
,
a
VP
may
be
the
primary
actor
for
get
sales
growth
report
by
region
use
case
,
though
it
may
actually
be
executed
by
an
assistant
.
We
consider
the
primary
actor
as
the
person
who
actually
uses
the
outcome
of
the
use
case
and
who
is
the
main
consumer
of
the
goal
.
Time-driven
trigger
is
another
example
of
how
a
use
case
may
be
executed
on
behalf
of
the
primary
actor
(
in
this
situation
the
report
is
generated
automatically
at
some
time
)
.
Note
,
however
,
that
although
the
goal
of
the
primary
actor
is
the
driving
force
behind
a
use
case
,
the
use
case
must
also
fulfill
goals
that
other
stake-
holders
might
have
for
this
use
case
.
That
is
,
the
main
goal
of
a
use
case
is
to
describe
behavior
of
the
system
that
results
in
satisfaction
of
the
goals
of
all
the
stakeholders
,
although
the
use
case
may
be
driven
by
the
goals
of
the
primary
actor
.
For
example
,
a
use
case
“
Withdraw
money
from
the
ATM
”
has
a
customer
as
its
primary
actor
and
will
normally
describe
the
entire
interac-
tion
of
the
customer
with
the
ATM
.
However
,
the
bank
is
also
a
stakeholder
of
the
ATM
system
and
its
goals
may
include
that
all
steps
are
logged
,
money
is
given
only
if
there
are
sufficient
funds
in
the
account
,
and
no
more
than
some
amount
is
given
at
a
time
,
etc
.
Satisfaction
of
these
goals
should
also
be
shown
by
the
use
case
“
Withdraw
money
from
the
ATM
.
”
For
describing
interaction
,
use
cases
use
scenarios
.
A
scenario
describes
a
set
of
actions
that
are
performed
to
achieve
a
goal
under
some
specified
con-
ditions
.
The
set
of
actions
is
generally
specified
as
a
sequence
(
as
that
is
the
most
convenient
way
to
express
it
in
text
)
,
though
in
actual
execution
the
ac-
tions
specified
may
be
executed
in
parallel
or
in
some
different
order
.
Each
step
in
a
scenario
is
a
logically
complete
action
performed
either
by
the
actor
or
the
system
.
Generally
,
a
step
is
some
action
by
the
actor
(
e.g.
,
enter
informa-
tion
)
,
some
logical
step
that
the
system
performs
to
progress
toward
achieving
its
goals
(
e.g.
,
validate
information
,
deliver
information
)
,
or
an
internal
state
change
by
the
system
to
satisfy
some
goals
(
e.g.
,
log
the
transaction
,
update
the
record
)
.
A
use
case
always
has
a
main
success
scenario
,
which
describes
the
interac-
tion
if
nothing
fails
and
all
steps
in
the
scenario
succeed
.
There
may
be
many
success
scenarios
.
Though
the
use
case
aims
to
achieve
its
goals
,
different
situ-
ations
can
arise
while
the
system
and
the
actor
are
interacting
which
may
not
permit
the
system
to
achieve
the
goal
fully
.
For
these
situations
,
a
use
case
has
extension
scenarios
which
describe
the
system
behavior
if
some
of
the
steps
in
the
main
scenario
do
not
complete
successfully
.
Sometimes
they
are
also
called
exception
scenarios
.
A
use
case
is
a
collection
of
all
the
success
and
extension
scenarios
related
to
the
goal
.
The
terminology
of
use
cases
is
summarized
in
Table
To
achieve
the
desired
goal
,
a
system
can
divide
it
into
subgoals
.
Some
of
these
subgoals
may
be
achieved
by
the
system
itself
,
but
they
may
also
be
treated
as
separate
use
cases
executed
by
supporting
actors
,
which
may
be
another
system
.
For
example
,
suppose
for
verifying
a
user
in
“
Withdraw
money
from
the
ATM
”
an
authentication
service
is
used
.
The
interaction
with
this
service
can
be
treated
as
a
separate
use
case
.
A
scenario
in
a
use
case
may
therefore
employ
another
use
case
for
performing
some
of
the
tasks
.
In
other
words
,
use
cases
permit
a
hierarchic
organization
.
It
should
be
evident
that
the
basic
system
model
that
use
cases
assume
is
that
a
system
primarily
responds
to
requests
from
actors
who
use
the
system
.
By
describing
the
interaction
between
actors
and
the
system
,
the
system
be-
havior
can
be
specified
,
and
through
the
behavior
its
functionality
is
specified
.
A
key
advantage
of
this
approach
is
that
use
cases
focus
on
external
behavior
,
thereby
cleanly
avoiding
doing
internal
design
during
requirements
,
something
that
is
desired
but
not
easy
to
do
with
many
modeling
approaches
.
Use
cases
are
naturally
textual
descriptions
,
and
represent
the
behavioral
requirements
of
the
system
.
This
behavior
specification
can
capture
most
of
the
functional
requirements
of
the
system
.
Therefore
,
use
cases
do
not
form
the
complete
SRS
,
but
can
form
a
part
of
it
.
The
complete
SRS
,
as
we
have
seen
,
will
need
to
capture
other
requirements
like
performance
and
design
constraints
.
Though
the
detailed
use
cases
are
textual
,
diagrams
can
be
used
to
sup-
plement
the
textual
description
.
For
example
,
the
use
case
diagram
of
UML
provides
an
overview
of
the
use
cases
and
actors
in
the
system
and
their
depen-
dency
.
A
UML
use
case
diagram
generally
shows
each
use
case
in
the
system
as
an
ellipse
,
shows
the
primary
actor
for
the
use
case
as
a
stick
figure
connected
to
the
use
case
with
a
line
,
and
shows
dependency
between
use
cases
by
arcs
between
use
cases
.
Some
other
relationships
between
use
cases
can
also
be
rep-
resented
.
However
,
as
use
cases
are
basically
textual
in
nature
,
diagrams
play
a
limited
role
in
either
developing
or
specifying
use
cases
.
We
will
not
discuss
use
case
diagrams
further
.
Let
us
illustrate
these
concepts
with
a
few
use
cases
,
which
we
will
also
use
to
explain
other
concepts
related
to
use
cases
.
Let
us
consider
that
a
small
on-line
auction
system
is
to
be
built
for
a
university
community
,
called
the
University
Auction
System
(
UAS
)
,
through
which
different
members
of
the
university
can
sell
and
buy
goods
.
We
will
assume
that
there
is
a
separate
financial
subsystem
through
which
the
payments
are
made
and
that
each
buyer
and
seller
has
an
account
in
it
.
In
this
system
,
though
we
have
the
same
people
who
might
be
buying
and
selling
,
we
have
“
buyers
”
and
“
sellers
”
as
separate
logical
actors
,
as
both
have
different
goals
to
achieve
.
Besides
these
,
the
auction
system
itself
is
a
stake-
holder
and
an
actor
.
The
financial
system
is
another
.
Let
us
first
consider
the
main
use
cases
of
this
system—
“
put
an
item
for
auction
,
”
“
make
a
bid
,
”
and
“
complete
an
auction.
”
These
use
cases
are
given
in
Figure
The
use
cases
are
self-explanatory
.
This
is
the
great
value
of
use
cases—they
are
natural
and
story-like
which
makes
them
easy
to
understand
by
both
an
an-
alyst
and
a
layman
.
This
helps
considerably
in
minimizing
the
communication
gap
between
the
developers
and
other
stakeholders
.
Some
points
about
the
use
case
are
worth
discussing
.
The
use
cases
are
generally
numbered
for
reference
purposes
.
The
name
of
the
use
case
specifies
the
goal
of
the
primary
actor
(
hence
there
is
no
separate
line
specifying
the
goal
)
.
The
primary
actor
can
be
a
person
or
a
system—for
UC2
,
they
are
persons
but
for
UC3
,
it
is
a
system
.
The
primary
actor
can
also
be
another
software
which
might
request
a
service
.
The
precondition
of
a
use
case
specifies
what
the
system
will
ensure
before
allowing
the
use
case
to
be
initiated
.
Common
preconditions
are
“
user
is
logged
in
,
”
“
input
data
exists
in
files
or
other
data
structures
,
”
etc
.
For
an
operation
like
delete
it
may
be
that
“
item
exists
,
”
or
for
a
tracking
use
case
it
may
be
that
the
“
tracking
number
is
valid
.
”
It
is
worth
noting
that
the
use
case
description
list
contains
some
actions
that
are
not
necessarily
tied
to
the
goals
of
the
primary
actor
.
For
example
,
the
last
step
in
UC
.
This
action
is
clearly
not
needed
by
the
current
bidder
for
his
goal
.
However
,
as
the
system
and
other
bidders
are
also
stakeholders
for
this
use
case
,
the
use
case
has
to
ensure
that
their
goals
are
also
satisfied
.
Similar
is
the
case
with
the
last
item
of
UC1
.
The
exception
situations
are
also
fairly
clear
.
We
have
listed
only
the
most
obvious
ones
.
There
can
be
many
more
,
depending
on
the
goals
of
the
organiza-
tion
.
For
example
,
there
could
be
one
“
user
does
not
complete
the
transaction
,
”
which
is
a
failure
condition
that
can
occur
anywhere
.

this
case
has
to
then
be
specified
(
e.g.
,
all
the
records
are
cleaned
)
.
A
use
case
can
employ
other
use
cases
to
perform
some
of
its
work
.
For
example
,
in
UC
“
block
the
necessary
funds
”
or
“
debit
bidder
’
s
account
and
credit
seller
’
s
”
are
actions
that
need
to
be
performed
for
the
use
case
to
succeed
.
However
,
they
are
not
performed
in
this
use
case
,
but
are
treated
as
use
cases
themselves
whose
behavior
has
to
be
described
elsewhere
.
If
these
use
cases
are
also
part
of
the
system
being
built
,
then
there
must
be
descriptions
of
these
in
the
requirements
document
.
If
they
belong
to
some
other
system
,
then
proper
specifications
about
them
will
have
to
be
obtained
.
The
financial
actions
may
easily
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
auction
system
,
so
will
not
be
described
in
the
SRS
.
However
,
actions
like
“
search
”
and
“
browse
”
are
most
likely
part
of
this
system
and
will
have
to
be
described
in
the
SRS
.
This
allows
use
cases
to
be
hierarchically
organized
and
refinement
approach
can
be
used
to
define
a
higher-level
use
case
in
terms
of
lower
services
and
then
defining
the
lower
services
.
However
,
these
lower-level
use
cases
are
proper
use
cases
with
a
primary
actor
,
main
scenario
,
etc
.
The
primary
actor
will
often
be
the
primary
actor
of
the
higher-level
use
case
.
For
example
,
the
primary
actor
for
the
use
case
“
find
an
item
”
is
the
buyer
.
It
also
implies
that
while
listing
the
scenarios
,
new
use
cases
and
new
actors
might
emerge
.
In
the
requirements
document
,
all
the
use
cases
that
are
mentioned
in
this
one
will
need
to
be
specified
if
they
are
a
part
of
the
system
being
built
.
Besides
specifying
the
primary
actor
,
its
goal
,
and
the
success
and
exceptional
scenarios
,
a
use
case
can
also
specify
a
scope
.
If
the
system
being
built
has
many
subsystems
,
as
is
often
the
case
,
sometimes
system
use
cases
may
actually
be
capturing
the
behavior
of
some
subsystem
.
In
such
a
situation
it
is
better
to
specify
the
scope
of
that
use
case
as
the
subsystem
.
For
example
,
a
use
case
for
a
system
may
be
log
in
.
Even
though
this
is
a
part
of
the
system
,
the
interaction
of
the
user
with
the
system
described
in
this
use
case
is
limited
to
the
interaction
with
the
“
login
and
authentication
”
subsystem
.
If
“
login
and
authentication
”
has
been
identified
as
a
subsystem
or
a
component
,
then
it
is
better
to
specify
it
as
the
scope
.
Generally
,
a
business
use
case
has
the
enterprise
or
the
organization
as
the
scope
;
a
system
use
case
has
the
system
being
built
as
the
scope
;
and
a
component
use
case
is
where
the
scope
is
a
subsystem
.
UCs
where
the
scope
is
the
enterprise
can
often
run
over
a
long
period
of
time
(
e.g.
,
process
an
application
of
a
prospective
candidate
)
.
These
use
cases
may
require
many
different
systems
to
perform
different
tasks
before
the
UC
can
be
completed
.
(
Example
:
for
processing
an
application
the
HR
department
has
to
do
some
things
,
the
travel
department
has
to
arrange
the
travel
and
lodging
,
and
the
technical
department
has
to
conduct
the
interview
.
)
The
system
and
subsystem
use
cases
are
generally
of
the
type
that
can
be
completed
in
one
relatively
short
sitting
.
All
the
three
use
cases
above
are
system
use
cases
.
As
mentioned
before
,
we
will
focus
on
describing
the
behavior
of
the
software
system
we
are
interested
in
building
.
However
,
the
enterprise-level
UCs
provide
the
context
in
which
the
systems
operate
.
Hence
,
sometimes
it
may
be
useful
to
describe
some
of
the
key
business
processes
as
summary-level
use
cases
to
provide
the
context
for
the
system
being
designed
and
built
.
For
example
,
let
us
describe
the
overall
use
case
of
performing
an
auction
.
A
possible
use
case
is
given
in
Figure
This
use
case
is
not
a
one-sitting
use
case
and
is
really
a
business
process
,
which
provides
the
context
for
the
earlier
use
cases
.
Though
this
use
case
is
also
largely
done
by
the
system
and
is
probably
part
of
the
system
being
built
,
frequently
such
use
cases
may
not
be
completely
part
of
the
software
system
and
may
involve
manual
steps
as
well
.
For
example
,
in
the
“
auction
an
item
”
use
case
,
if
the
delivery
of
the
item
being
auctioned
was
to
be
ensured
by
the
auctioning
site
,
then
that
will
be
a
step
in
this
use
case
and
it
will
be
a
manual
step
.
Use
cases
may
also
specify
post
conditions
for
the
main
success
scenario
,
or
some
minimal
guarantees
they
provide
in
all
conditions
.
For
example
,
in
some
use
cases
,
atomicity
may
be
a
minimal
guarantee
.
That
is
,
no
matter
what
exceptions
occur
,
either
the
entire
transaction
will
be
completed
and
the
goal
achieved
,
or
the
system
state
will
be
as
if
nothing
was
done
.
With
atomicity
,
there
will
be
no
partial
results
and
any
partial
changes
will
be
rolled
back
.
UCs
not
only
document
requirements
,
as
their
form
is
like
storytelling
and
uses
text
,
both
of
which
are
easy
and
natural
with
different
stakeholders
,
they
also
are
a
good
medium
for
discussion
and
brainstorming
.
Hence
,
UCs
can
also
be
used
for
requirements
elicitation
and
problem
analysis
.
While
developing
use
cases
,
informal
or
formal
models
may
also
be
built
,
though
they
are
not
required
.
UCs
can
be
evolved
in
a
stepwise
refinement
manner
with
each
step
adding
more
details
.
This
approach
allows
UCs
to
be
presented
at
different
levels
of
ab-
straction
.
Though
any
number
of
levels
of
abstraction
are
possible
,
four
natural
levels
emerge
:
Actors
and
goals
.
The
actor-goal
list
enumerates
the
use
cases
and
specifies
the
actors
for
each
goal
.
(
The
name
of
the
use
case
is
generally
the
goal
.
)
This
table
may
be
extended
by
giving
a
brief
description
of
each
of
the
use
cases
.
At
this
level
,
the
use
cases
together
specify
the
scope
of
the
system
and
give
an
overall
view
of
what
it
does
.
Completeness
of
functionality
can
be
assessed
fairly
well
by
reviewing
these
.
Main
success
scenarios
.
For
each
of
the
use
cases
,
the
main
success
scenar-
ios
are
provided
at
this
level
.
With
the
main
scenarios
,
the
system
behavior
for
each
use
case
is
specified
.
This
description
can
be
reviewed
to
ensure
that
interests
of
all
the
stakeholders
are
met
and
that
the
use
case
is
delivering
the
desired
behavior
.
Failure
conditions
.
Once
the
success
scenario
is
listed
,
all
the
possible
failure
conditions
can
be
identified
.
At
this
level
,
for
each
step
in
the
main
success
scenario
,
the
different
ways
in
which
a
step
can
fail
form
the
failure
conditions
.
Before
deciding
what
should
be
done
in
these
failure
conditions
(
which
is
done
at
the
next
level
)
,
it
is
better
to
enumerate
the
failure
condi-
tions
and
review
for
completeness
.
Failure
handling
.
This
is
perhaps
the
most
tricky
and
difficult
part
of
writing
a
use
case
.
Often
the
focus
is
so
much
on
the
main
functionality
that
people
do
not
pay
attention
to
how
failures
should
be
handled
.
Determining
what
should
be
the
behavior
under
different
failure
conditions
will
often
identify
new
business
rules
or
new
actors
.
The
different
levels
can
be
used
for
different
purposes
.
For
discussion
on
overall
functionality
or
capabilities
of
the
system
,
actors
and
goal-level
descrip-
tion
is
very
useful
.
Failure
conditions
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
very
useful
for
understanding
and
extracting
detailed
requirements
and
business
rules
under
special
cases
.
These
four
levels
can
also
guide
the
analysis
activity
.
A
step-by-step
ap-
proach
for
analysis
when
employing
use
cases
is
:
Step
1
.
Identify
the
actors
and
their
goals
and
get
an
agreement
with
the
concerned
stakeholders
as
to
the
goals
.
The
actor-goal
list
will
clearly
define
the
scope
of
the
system
and
will
provide
an
overall
view
of
what
the
system
capabilities
are
.
Step
2
.
Understand
and
specify
the
main
success
scenario
for
each
UC
,
giving
more
details
about
the
main
functions
of
the
system
.
Interaction
and
dis-
cussion
are
the
primary
means
to
uncover
these
scenarios
though
models
may
be
built
,
if
required
.
During
this
step
,
the
analyst
may
uncover
that
to
complete
some
use
case
some
other
use
cases
are
needed
,
which
have
not
been
identified
.
In
this
case
,
the
list
of
use
cases
will
be
expanded
.
Step
3
.
When
the
main
success
scenario
for
a
use
case
is
agreed
upon
and
the
main
steps
in
its
execution
are
specified
,
then
the
failure
conditions
can
be
examined
.
Enumerating
failure
conditions
is
an
excellent
method
of
uncovering
special
situations
that
can
occur
and
which
must
be
handled
by
the
system
.
Step
4
.
Finally
,
specify
what
should
be
done
for
these
failure
conditions
.
As
details
of
handling
failure
scenarios
can
require
a
lot
of
effort
and
discussion
,
it
is
better
to
first
enumerate
the
different
failure
conditions
and
then
get
the
details
of
these
scenarios
.
Very
often
,
when
deciding
the
failure
scenarios
,
many
new
business
rules
of
how
to
deal
with
these
scenarios
are
uncovered
.
Though
we
have
explained
the
basic
steps
in
developing
use
cases
,
at
any
step
an
analyst
may
have
to
go
back
to
earlier
steps
as
during
some
detailed
analysis
new
actors
may
emerge
or
new
goals
and
new
use
cases
may
be
un-
covered
.
That
is
,
using
use
cases
for
analysis
is
also
an
interactive
task
.
What
should
be
the
level
of
detail
in
a
use
case
?
There
is
no
one
answer
to
a
question
like
this
;
the
actual
answer
always
depends
on
the
project
and
the
situation
.
So
it
is
with
use
cases
.
Generally
it
is
good
to
have
sufficient
details
which
are
not
overwhelming
but
are
sufficient
to
build
the
system
and
meet
its
quality
goals
.
For
example
,
if
there
is
a
small
collocated
team
building
the
system
,
it
is
quite
likely
that
use
cases
which
list
the
main
exception
conditions
and
give
a
few
key
steps
for
the
scenarios
will
suffice
.
On
the
other
hand
,
for
a
project
whose
development
is
to
be
subcontracted
to
some
other
organization
,
it
is
better
to
have
more
detailed
use
cases
.
For
writing
use
cases
,
general
technical
writing
rules
apply
.
Use
simple
gram-
mar
,
clearly
specify
who
is
performing
the
step
,
and
keep
the
overall
scenario
as
simple
as
possible
.
Also
,
when
writing
steps
,
for
simplicity
,
it
is
better
to
combine
some
steps
into
one
logical
step
,
if
it
makes
sense
.
For
example
,
steps
“
user
enters
his
name
,
”
“
user
enters
his
SSN
,
”
and
“
user
enters
his
address
”
can
be
easily
combined
into
one
step
“
user
enters
personal
information
.
”
The
basic
aim
of
problem
analysis
is
to
obtain
a
clear
understanding
of
the
needs
of
the
clients
and
the
users
,
what
exactly
is
desired
from
the
software
,
and
what
the
constraints
on
the
solution
are
.
Frequently
the
client
and
the
users
do
not
understand
or
know
all
their
needs
,
because
the
potential
of
the
new
system
is
often
not
fully
appreciated
.
The
analysts
have
to
ensure
that
the
real
needs
of
the
clients
and
the
users
are
uncovered
,
even
if
they
don
’
t
know
them
clearly
.
That
is
,
the
analysts
are
not
just
collecting
and
organizing
information
about
the
client
’
s
organization
and
its
processes
,
but
they
also
act
as
consultants
who
play
an
active
role
of
helping
the
clients
and
users
identify
their
needs
.
The
basic
principle
used
in
analysis
is
the
same
as
in
any
complex
task
:
divide
and
conquer
.
That
is
,
partition
the
problem
into
subproblems
and
then
try
to
understand
each
subproblem
and
its
relationship
to
other
subproblems
in
an
effort
to
understand
the
total
problem
.
The
concepts
of
state
and
projection
can
sometimes
also
be
used
effectively
in
the
partitioning
process
.
A
state
of
a
system
represents
some
conditions
about
the
system
.
Frequently
,
when
using
state
,
a
system
is
first
viewed
as
operating
in
one
of
the
several
possible
states
,
and
then
a
detailed
analysis
is
performed
for
each
state
.
This
approach
is
sometimes
used
in
real-time
software
or
process-control
software
.
In
projection
,
a
system
is
defined
from
multiple
points
of
view
[
86
]
.
While
using
projection
,
different
viewpoints
of
the
system
are
defined
and
the
system
is
then
analyzed
from
these
different
perspectives
.
The
different
“
projections
”
obtained
are
combined
to
form
the
analysis
for
the
complete
system
.
Analyzing
the
system
from
the
different
perspectives
is
often
easier
,
as
it
limits
and
focuses
the
scope
of
the
study
.
In
the
remainder
of
this
section
we
will
discuss
two
other
methods
for
prob-
lem
analysis
.
As
the
goal
of
analysis
is
to
understand
the
problem
domain
,
an
analyst
must
be
familiar
with
different
methods
of
analysis
and
pick
the
approach
that
he
feels
is
best
suited
to
the
problem
at
hand
.
Data
flow
diagrams
(
also
called
data
flow
graphs
)
are
commonly
used
during
problem
analysis
.
Data
flow
diagrams
(
DFDs
)
are
quite
general
and
are
not
limited
to
problem
analysis
for
software
requirements
specification
.
They
were
in
use
long
before
the
software
engineering
discipline
began
.
DFDs
are
very
useful
in
understanding
a
system
and
can
be
effectively
used
during
analysis
.
A
DFD
shows
the
flow
of
data
through
a
system
.
It
views
a
system
as
a
function
that
transforms
the
inputs
into
desired
outputs
.
Any
complex
system
will
not
perform
this
transformation
in
a
“
single
step
,
”
and
data
will
typically
undergo
a
series
of
transformations
before
it
becomes
the
output
.
The
DFD
aims
to
capture
the
transformations
that
take
place
within
a
system
to
the
input
data
so
that
eventually
the
output
data
is
produced
.
The
agent
that
performs
the
transformation
of
data
from
one
state
to
another
is
called
a
process
(
or
a
bubble
)
.
Thus
,
a
DFD
shows
the
movement
of
data
through
the
different
transformations
or
processes
in
the
system
.
The
processes
are
shown
by
named
circles
and
data
flows
are
represented
by
named
arrows
entering
or
leaving
the
bubbles
.
A
rectangle
represents
a
source
or
sink
and
is
a
net
originator
or
consumer
of
data
.
A
source
or
a
sink
is
typically
outside
the
main
system
of
study
.
An
example
of
a
DFD
for
a
system
that
pays
workers
is
shown
in
Figure
In
this
DFD
there
is
one
basic
input
data
flow
,
the
weekly
timesheet
,
which
originates
from
the
source
worker
.
The
basic
output
is
the
paycheck
,
the
sink
for
which
is
also
the
worker
.
In
this
system
,
first
the
employee
’
s
record
is
re-
trieved
,
using
the
employee
ID
,
which
is
contained
in
the
timesheet
.
From
the
employee
record
,
the
rate
of
payment
and
overtime
are
obtained
.
These
rates
and
the
regular
and
overtime
hours
(
from
the
timesheet
)
are
used
to
compute
the
pay
.
After
the
total
pay
is
determined
,
taxes
are
deducted
.
To
compute
the
tax
deduction
,
information
from
the
tax-rate
file
is
used
.
The
amount
of
tax
deducted
is
recorded
in
the
employee
and
company
records
.
Finally
,
the
pay-
check
is
issued
for
the
net
pay
.
The
amount
paid
is
also
recorded
in
company
records
.
Some
conventions
used
in
drawing
this
DFD
should
be
explained
.
All
ex-
ternal
files
such
as
employee
record
,
company
record
,
and
tax
rates
are
shown
as
a
labeled
straight
line
.
The
need
for
multiple
data
flows
by
a
process
is
rep-
resented
by
a
“
*
”
between
the
data
flows
.
This
symbol
represents
the
AND
relationship
.
For
example
,
if
there
is
a
“
*
”
between
the
two
input
data
flows
A
and
B
for
a
process
,
it
means
that
A
AND
B
are
needed
for
the
process
.
In
the
DFD
,
for
the
process
“
weekly
pay
”
the
data
flow
“
hours
”
and
“
pay
rate
”
both
are
needed
,
as
shown
in
the
DFD
.
Similarly
,
the
OR
relationship
is
represented
by
a
“
+
”
between
the
data
flows
.
This
DFD
is
an
abstract
description
of
the
system
for
handling
payment
.
It
does
not
matter
if
the
system
is
automated
or
manual
.
This
diagram
could
very
well
be
for
a
manual
system
where
the
computations
are
all
done
with
calculators
,
and
the
records
are
physical
folders
and
ledgers
.
The
details
and
minor
data
paths
are
not
represented
in
this
DFD
.
For
example
,
what
happens
if
there
are
errors
in
the
weekly
timesheet
is
not
shown
in
this
DFD
.
This
is
done
to
avoid
getting
bogged
down
with
details
while
constructing
a
DFD
for
the
overall
system
.
If
more
details
are
desired
,
the
DFD
can
be
further
refined
.
It
should
be
pointed
out
that
a
DFD
is
not
a
flowchart
.
A
DFD
represents
the
flow
of
data
,
while
a
flowchart
shows
the
flow
of
control
.
A
DFD
does
not
represent
procedural
information
.
So
,
while
drawing
a
DFD
,
one
must
not
get
involved
in
procedural
details
,
and
procedural
thinking
must
be
consciously
avoided
.
For
example
,
considerations
of
loops
and
decisions
must
be
ignored
.
In
drawing
the
DFD
,
the
designer
has
to
specify
the
major
transforms
in
the
path
of
the
data
flowing
from
the
input
to
output
.
How
those
transforms
are
performed
is
not
an
issue
while
drawing
the
data
flow
graph
.
Many
systems
are
too
large
for
a
single
DFD
to
describe
the
data
processing
clearly
.
It
is
necessary
that
some
decomposition
and
abstraction
mechanism
be
used
for
such
systems
.
DFDs
can
be
hierarchically
organized
,
which
helps
in
progressively
partitioning
and
analyzing
large
systems
.
Such
DFDs
together
are
called
a
leveled
DFD
set
[
28
]
.
A
leveled
DFD
set
has
a
starting
DFD
,
which
is
a
very
abstract
represen-
tation
of
the
system
,
identifying
the
major
inputs
and
outputs
and
the
major
processes
in
the
system
.
Often
,
before
the
initial
DFD
,
a
context
diagram
may
be
drawn
in
which
the
entire
system
is
shown
as
a
single
process
with
all
its
inputs
,
outputs
,
sinks
,
and
sources
.
Then
each
process
is
refined
and
a
DFD
is
drawn
for
the
process
.
In
other
words
,
a
bubble
in
a
DFD
is
expanded
into
a
DFD
during
refinement
.
For
the
hierarchy
to
be
consistent
,
it
is
important
that
the
net
inputs
and
outputs
of
a
DFD
for
a
process
are
the
same
as
the
inputs
and
outputs
of
the
process
in
the
higher-level
DFD
.
This
refinement
stops
if
each
bubble
is
considered
to
be
“
atomic
,
”
in
that
each
bubble
can
be
easily
specified
or
understood
.
It
should
be
pointed
out
that
during
refine-
ment
,
though
the
net
input
and
output
are
preserved
,
a
refinement
of
the
data
might
also
occur
.
That
is
,
a
unit
of
data
may
be
broken
into
its
components
for
processing
when
the
detailed
DFD
for
a
process
is
being
drawn
.
So
,
as
the
processes
are
decomposed
,
data
decomposition
also
occurs
.
In
a
DFD
,
data
flows
are
identified
by
unique
names
.
These
names
are
chosen
so
that
they
convey
some
meaning
about
what
the
data
is
.
However
,
for
specifying
the
precise
structure
of
data
flows
,
a
data
dictionary
is
often
used
.
The
associated
data
dictionary
states
precisely
the
structure
of
each
data
flow
in
the
DFD
.
To
define
the
data
structure
,
a
regular
expression
type
notation
is
used
.
While
specifying
the
structure
of
a
data
item
,
sequence
or
composition
is
represented
by
“
+
”
,
selection
by
vertical
bar
“
”
(
means
one
OR
the
other
)
,
and
repetition
by
“
*
”
.
Entity
relationship
diagrams
(
ERDs
)
have
been
used
for
years
for
modeling
the
data
aspects
of
a
system
.
An
ERD
can
be
used
to
model
the
data
in
the
system
and
how
the
data
items
relate
to
each
other
,
but
does
not
cover
how
the
data
is
to
be
processed
or
how
the
data
is
actually
manipulated
and
changed
in
the
system
.
It
is
used
often
by
database
designers
to
represent
the
structure
of
the
database
and
is
a
useful
tool
for
analyzing
software
systems
which
employ
databases
.
ER
models
form
the
logical
database
design
and
can
be
easily
converted
into
initial
table
structure
for
a
relational
database
.
ER
diagrams
have
two
main
concepts
and
notations
to
representing
them
.
These
are
entities
and
relationships
.
Entities
are
the
main
information
holders
or
concepts
in
a
system
.
Entities
can
be
viewed
as
types
which
describe
all
elements
of
some
type
which
have
common
properties
.
Entities
are
represented
as
boxes
in
an
ER
diagram
,
with
a
box
representing
all
instances
of
the
concept
or
type
the
entity
is
representing
.
An
entity
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
table
in
a
database
or
a
sheet
in
a
spreadsheet
,
with
each
row
representing
an
instance
of
this
entity
.
Entities
may
have
attributes
,
which
are
properties
of
the
concept
being
represented
.
Attributes
can
be
viewed
as
the
columns
of
the
database
table
and
are
represented
as
ellipses
attached
to
the
entity
.
To
avoid
cluttering
,
attributes
are
sometimes
not
shown
in
an
ER
diagram
.
If
all
identities
are
identified
and
represented
,
we
will
have
a
set
of
labeled
boxes
in
the
diagram
,
each
box
representing
some
entity
.
Entities
,
of
course
,
do
not
exist
in
isolation
.
They
have
relationships
between
them
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
exist
together
in
the
same
system
.
Relationships
between
two
entities
are
represented
by
a
line
connecting
the
boxes
representing
the
entities
.
Having
a
line
between
two
boxes
means
that
each
element
of
one
entity
is
related
to
elements
of
the
other
entity
,
and
vice
versa
.
This
relationship
can
also
be
given
a
name
by
labeling
the
line
.
In
some
notations
,
the
name
of
the
relationship
is
mentioned
inside
a
diamond
.
Some
examples
of
relationships
are
:
studies-in
(
between
students
and
college
)
,
works-
for
(
between
employees
and
companies
)
,
and
owner
(
between
people
and
cars
)
.
Note
that
the
relationships
need
not
be
between
two
distinct
entities
.
There
can
be
a
relationship
between
elements
of
the
same
entity
.
For
example
,
for
an
entity
type
Employee
,
there
can
be
a
relationship
Supervisor
,
which
is
between
elements
of
the
entity
Employee
.
An
ER
diagram
specifies
some
properties
of
the
relationship
also
.
In
par-
ticular
,
it
can
specify
if
the
relationship
is
optional
(
or
necessary
)
,
and
with
how
many
elements
an
element
of
an
entity
is
related
to
.
This
leads
to
many
forms
of
relationships
.
The
common
ones
are
one-to-one
(
that
one
element
of
an
entity
is
related
to
exactly
one
element
of
the
other
entity
)
,
one-to-many
or
many-to-one
(
that
one
element
is
related
to
many
elements
of
the
other
entity
)
,
and
many-to-many
(
that
one
element
of
entity
A
is
related
to
many
elements
of
entity
B
and
one
element
of
entity
B
is
related
to
many
elements
of
entity
A
)
.
There
are
various
notations
to
express
the
nature
of
relationships
;
a
common
one
is
to
put
“
0
”
,
“
1
”
,
or
“
M
”
on
the
two
sides
of
the
relationship
line
to
rep-
resent
the
cardinality
of
the
relationship
.
Thus
,
for
a
one-to-many
relationship
,
a
“
1
”
will
be
put
on
one
end
and
“
N
”
will
be
put
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
.
Relationships
reflect
some
properties
of
the
problem
domain
.
For
example
,
a
course
has
many
students
and
a
student
is
taking
many
courses
,
leading
to
many-to-many
relationship
between
courses
and
students
.
But
a
student
studies
in
exactly
one
college
though
the
college
has
many
students
,
leading
to
many-
to-one
relationship
between
students
and
college
.
A
department
in
a
college
has
exactly
one
head
,
and
one
person
can
be
Head
of
only
one
department
,
leading
to
one-to-one
relationship
.
Let
us
draw
the
ER
diagram
for
the
university
auction
system
,
some
use
cases
of
which
were
discussed
earlier
.
From
the
use
cases
described
,
we
can
easily
identify
some
entities—users
,
categories
,
items
,
and
bids
.
The
relationships
between
them
are
also
clear
.
A
user
can
sell
many
items
,
but
each
item
has
only
one
seller
,
so
there
is
a
one-to-many
relationship
“
Sell
”
between
the
user
and
items
.
Similarly
,
there
is
a
one-to-many
relationship
between
items
and
bids
,
between
users
and
bids
,
and
between
categories
and
items
.
The
ER
diagram
of
this
is
shown
in
Figure
From
the
ER
diagram
,
it
is
easy
to
determine
the
initial
logical
structure
of
the
tables
.
Each
entity
represents
a
table
,
and
relationships
determine
what
fields
a
table
must
have
to
support
the
relationship
,
in
addition
to
having
fields
for
each
of
the
attributes
.
For
example
,
from
the
ER
diagram
for
the
auction
system
,
we
can
say
that
there
will
be
four
tables
for
users
,
categories
,
items
,
and
bids
.
As
user
is
related
to
item
by
one-to-many
,
the
item
table
should
have
a
user-ID
field
to
uniquely
identify
the
user
who
is
selling
the
item
.
Similarly
,
the
bid
table
must
have
a
user-ID
to
identify
the
user
who
placed
the
bid
,
and
an
item-ID
to
identify
the
item
for
which
the
bid
has
been
made
.
As
we
can
see
,
an
ER
diagram
is
complementary
to
methods
like
use
cases
.
Whereas
use
cases
focus
on
the
nature
of
interaction
and
functionality
,
ER
diagrams
focus
on
the
structure
of
the
entities
being
used
in
the
use
cases
.
Due
to
their
complementary
nature
,
both
use
cases
and
ER
diagrams
can
be
used
while
analyzing
the
requirements
of
a
system
and
both
may
be
contained
in
an
SRS
.
The
development
of
software
starts
with
a
requirements
document
,
which
is
also
used
to
determine
eventually
whether
or
not
the
delivered
software
system
is
acceptable
.
It
is
therefore
important
that
the
requirements
specification
con-
tains
no
errors
and
specifies
the
client
’
s
requirements
correctly
.
Furthermore
,
as
the
longer
an
error
remains
undetected
,
the
greater
the
cost
of
correcting
it
,
it
is
extremely
desirable
to
detect
errors
in
the
requirements
before
the
design
and
development
of
the
software
begin
.
Due
to
the
nature
of
the
requirements
specification
phase
,
there
is
a
lot
of
room
for
misunderstanding
and
committing
errors
,
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
requirements
specification
does
not
accurately
represent
the
client
’
s
needs
.
The
basic
objective
of
the
requirements
validation
activity
is
to
ensure
that
the
SRS
reflects
the
actual
requirements
accurately
and
clearly
.
A
related
objective
is
to
check
that
the
SRS
document
is
itself
of
good
quality
.
Before
we
discuss
validation
,
let
us
consider
the
type
of
errors
that
typically
occur
in
an
SRS
.
Many
different
types
of
errors
are
possible
,
but
the
most
com-
mon
errors
that
occur
can
be
classified
in
four
types
:
omission
,
inconsistency
,
incorrect
fact
,
and
ambiguity
.
Omission
is
a
common
error
in
requirements
.
In
this
type
of
error
,
some
user
requirement
is
simply
not
included
in
the
SRS
;
the
omitted
requirement
may
be
related
to
the
behavior
of
the
system
,
its
perfor-
mance
,
constraints
,
or
any
other
factor
.
Omission
directly
affects
the
external
completeness
of
the
SRS
.
Another
common
form
of
error
in
requirements
is
inconsistency
.
Inconsistency
can
be
due
to
contradictions
within
the
require-
ments
themselves
or
to
incompatibility
of
the
stated
requirements
with
the
actual
requirements
of
the
client
or
with
the
environment
in
which
the
system
will
operate
.
The
third
common
requirement
error
is
incorrect
fact
.
Errors
of
this
type
occur
when
some
fact
recorded
in
the
SRS
is
not
correct
.
The
fourth
common
error
type
is
ambiguity
.
Errors
of
this
type
occur
when
there
are
some
requirements
that
have
multiple
meanings
,
that
is
,
their
interpretation
is
not
unique
.
Some
projects
have
collected
data
about
requirement
errors
.
In
[
27
]
the
effectiveness
of
different
methods
and
tools
in
detecting
requirement
errors
in
specifications
for
a
data
processing
application
is
reported
.
On
average
,
a
total
of
more
than
250
errors
were
detected
,
and
the
percentage
of
different
types
of
errors
was
:
In
[
5
]
the
errors
detected
in
the
requirements
specification
of
the
A-
(
which
deals
with
a
real-time
flight
control
software
)
were
reported
.
A
total
of
about
80
errors
were
detected
,
out
of
which
about
23
%
were
clerical
in
nature
.
Of
the
remaining
,
the
distribution
with
error
type
was
:
Though
the
distribution
of
errors
is
different
in
these
two
cases
,
reflecting
the
difference
in
application
domains
and
the
error
detection
methods
used
,
they
do
suggest
that
the
major
problems
(
besides
clerical
errors
)
are
omission
,
incorrect
fact
,
inconsistency
,
and
ambiguity
.
If
we
take
the
average
of
the
two
data
tables
,
it
shows
that
all
four
classes
of
errors
are
very
significant
,
and
a
good
fraction
of
errors
belong
to
each
of
these
types
.
This
implies
that
besides
improving
the
quality
of
the
SRS
itself
(
e.g.
,
no
clerical
errors
)
,
the
validation
should
focus
on
uncovering
these
types
of
errors
.
As
requirements
are
generally
textual
documents
that
can
not
be
executed
,
inspections
and
reviews
are
eminently
suitable
for
requirements
validation
.
Consequently
,
inspections
of
the
SRS
,
frequently
called
requirements
review
,
are
the
most
common
method
of
validation
.
Because
requirements
specifica-
tion
formally
specifies
something
that
originally
existed
informally
in
people
’
s
minds
,
requirements
validation
must
involve
the
clients
and
the
users
.
Due
to
this
,
the
requirements
review
team
generally
consists
of
client
as
well
as
user
representatives
.
Requirements
review
is
a
review
by
a
group
of
people
to
find
errors
and
point
out
other
matters
of
concern
in
the
requirements
specifications
of
a
system
.
The
review
group
should
include
the
author
of
the
requirements
document
,
someone
who
understands
the
needs
of
the
client
,
a
person
of
the
design
team
,
and
the
person
(
s
)
responsible
for
maintaining
the
requirements
document
.
It
is
also
good
practice
to
include
some
people
not
directly
involved
with
product
development
,
like
a
software
quality
engineer
.
Although
the
primary
goal
of
the
review
process
is
to
reveal
any
errors
in
the
requirements
,
such
as
those
discussed
earlier
,
the
review
process
is
also
used
to
consider
factors
affecting
quality
,
such
as
testability
and
readability
.
During
the
review
,
one
of
the
jobs
of
the
reviewers
is
to
uncover
the
requirements
that
are
too
subjective
and
too
difficult
to
define
criteria
for
testing
that
requirement
.
During
the
review
,
the
review
team
must
go
through
each
requirement
and
if
any
errors
are
there
,
then
they
discuss
and
agree
on
the
nature
of
the
error
.
A
detailed
inspection
process
may
be
used
(
we
will
discuss
one
such
process
later
in
Chapter
)
.
Requirements
reviews
are
probably
the
most
effective
means
for
detecting
requirement
errors
.
The
data
in
[
5
]
about
the
A-33
%
of
the
total
requirement
errors
detected
were
detected
by
review
processes
,
and
about
45
%
of
the
requirement
errors
were
detected
during
the
design
phase
when
the
requirement
document
is
used
as
a
reference
for
design
.
This
clearly
suggests
that
if
requirements
are
reviewed
then
,
not
only
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
errors
are
detected
by
them
,
but
a
vast
majority
of
the
remaining
errors
are
detected
soon
afterward
in
the
design
activity
.
Though
requirements
reviews
remain
the
most
commonly
used
and
viable
means
for
requirement
validation
,
other
possibilities
arise
if
some
special-
purpose
tools
for
modeling
and
analysis
are
used
.
For
example
,
if
the
require-
ments
are
written
in
a
formal
specification
language
or
a
language
specifically
designed
for
machine
processing
,
then
it
is
possible
to
have
tools
to
verify
some
properties
of
requirements
.
These
tools
will
focus
on
checks
for
internal
con-
sistency
and
completeness
,
which
sometimes
lead
to
checking
of
external
com-
pleteness
.
However
,
these
tools
can
not
directly
check
for
external
completeness
(
after
all
,
how
will
a
tool
know
that
some
requirement
has
been
completely
omitted
?
)
.
For
this
reason
,
requirements
reviews
are
needed
even
if
the
re-
quirements
are
specified
through
a
tool
or
are
in
a
formal
notation
.
The
main
goal
of
the
requirements
process
is
to
produce
the
software
require-
ments
specification
(
SRS
)
which
accurately
captures
the
client
’
s
requirements
and
which
forms
the
basis
of
software
development
and
validation
.
There
are
three
basic
activities
in
the
requirements
process—problem
anal-
ysis
,
specification
,
and
validation
.
The
goal
of
analysis
is
to
understand
the
different
aspects
of
the
problem
,
its
context
,
and
how
it
fits
within
the
client
’
s
organization
.
In
requirements
specification
the
understood
problem
is
speci-
fied
or
written
,
producing
the
SRS
.
Requirements
validation
is
done
to
ensure
that
the
requirements
specified
in
the
SRS
are
indeed
what
are
desired
.
The
key
desirable
characteristics
of
an
SRS
are
:
correctness
,
completeness
,
consistency
,
unambiguousness
,
verifiability
,
and
ranked
for
importance
.
A
good
SRS
should
specify
all
the
functions
the
software
needs
to
support
,
performance
requirements
of
the
system
,
the
design
constraints
that
exist
,
and
all
the
external
interfaces
.
Use
cases
are
a
popular
approach
for
specifying
functional
requirements
.
Each
use
case
specifies
the
interaction
of
the
system
with
the
primary
actor
,
who
initiates
the
use
case
for
achieving
some
goal
.
A
use
case
has
a
precondition
,
a
normal
scenario
,
as
well
as
many
excep-
tional
scenarios
,
thereby
providing
the
complete
behavior
of
the
system
.
For
developing
use
cases
,
first
the
actors
and
goal
should
be
identified
,
then
the
main
success
scenarios
,
then
the
failure
conditions
,
and
finally
the
failure
handling
.
With
data
flow
diagrams
,
a
system
is
analyzed
from
the
point
of
view
of
how
data
flows
through
the
system
.
A
DFD
consists
of
processes
and
data
flows
through
the
processes
.
Omission
,
incorrect
fact
,
inconsistency
,
and
ambiguity
are
the
most
common
errors
in
an
SRS
.
For
validation
,
the
most
commonly
used
method
is
doing
a
structured
group
review
of
the
requirements
.
The
basic
goal
of
the
requirements
activity
is
to
get
an
SRS
that
has
some
desirable
properties
.

role
of
modeling
in
developing
such
an
SRS

What
are
the
main
components

an
SRS

And
what
are

main

evaluating
the
quality
of
an
SRS

which

,

chairs
to
assign
reviewers
and
do
the
final
paper
selection
based
on
reviews
,
and
reviewers
to
enter
the
review
.

Planning
is
the
most
important
project
management
activity
.
It
has
two
ba-
sic
objectives—establish
reasonable
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
goals
for
the
project
,
and
to
draw
out
a
plan
to
deliver
the
project
goals
.
A
project
succeeds
if
it
meets
its
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
goals
.
Without
the
project
goals
be-
ing
defined
,
it
is
not
possible
to
even
declare
if
a
project
has
succeeded
.
And
without
detailed
planning
,
no
real
monitoring
or
controlling
of
the
project
is
possible
.
Often
projects
are
rushed
toward
implementation
with
not
enough
effort
spent
on
planning
.
No
amount
of
technical
effort
later
can
compensate
for
lack
of
careful
planning
.
Lack
of
proper
planning
is
a
sure
ticket
to
fail-
ure
for
a
large
software
project
.
For
this
reason
,
we
treat
project
planning
as
an
independent
chapter
.
Note
that
we
also
cover
the
monitoring
phase
of
the
project
management
process
as
part
of
planning
,
as
how
the
project
is
to
be
monitored
is
also
a
part
of
the
planning
phase
.
The
inputs
to
the
planning
activity
are
the
requirements
specification
and
maybe
the
architecture
description
.
A
very
detailed
requirements
document
is
not
essential
for
planning
,
but
for
a
good
plan
all
the
important
requirements
must
be
known
,
and
it
is
highly
desirable
that
key
architecture
decisions
have
been
taken
.
There
are
generally
two
main
outputs
of
the
planning
activity
:
the
overall
project
management
plan
document
that
establishes
the
project
goals
on
the
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
fronts
,
and
defines
the
plans
for
managing
risk
,
monitoring
the
project
,
etc
.
;
and
the
detailed
plan
,
often
referred
to
as
the
detailed
project
schedule
,
specifying
the
tasks
that
need
to
be
performed
to
meet
the
goals
,
the
resources
who
will
perform
them
,
and
their
schedule
.
The
P.
Jalote
,
A
Concise
Introduction
to
Software
Engineering
,
overall
plan
guides
the
development
of
the
detailed
plan
,
which
then
becomes
the
main
guiding
document
during
project
execution
for
project
monitoring
.
How
to
estimate
effort
and
schedule
for
the
project
to
establish
project
goals
and
milestones
and
determine
the
team
size
needed
for
executing
the
project
.
How
to
establish
quality
goals
for
the
project
and
prepare
a
quality
plan
.
How
to
identify
high-priority
risks
that
can
threaten
the
success
of
the
project
,
and
plan
for
their
mitigation
.
How
to
plan
for
monitoring
a
project
using
measurements
to
check
if
a
project
is
progressing
as
per
the
plan
.
How
to
develop
a
detailed
task
schedule
from
the
overall
estimates
and
other
planning
tasks
done
such
that
,
if
followed
,
the
overall
goals
of
the
project
will
be
met
.
For
a
software
development
project
,
overall
effort
and
schedule
estimates
are
essential
prerequisites
for
planning
the
project
.
These
estimates
are
needed
before
development
is
initiated
,
as
they
establish
the
cost
and
schedule
goals
of
the
project
.
Without
these
,
even
simple
questions
like
“
is
the
project
late
?
”
“
are
there
cost
overruns
?
”
and
“
when
is
the
project
likely
to
complete
?
”
can
not
be
answered
.
A
more
practical
use
of
these
estimates
is
in
bidding
for
software
projects
,
where
cost
and
schedule
estimates
must
be
given
to
a
potential
client
for
the
development
contract
.
(
As
the
bulk
of
the
cost
of
software
development
is
due
to
the
human
effort
,
cost
can
easily
be
determined
from
effort
by
using
a
suitable
person-month
cost
value
.
)
Effort
and
schedule
estimates
are
also
required
for
determining
the
staffing
level
for
a
project
during
different
phases
,
for
the
detailed
plan
,
and
for
project
monitoring
.
The
accuracy
with
which
effort
can
be
estimated
clearly
depends
on
the
level
of
information
available
about
the
project
.
The
more
detailed
the
infor-
mation
,
the
more
accurate
the
estimation
can
be
.
Of
course
,
even
with
all
the
information
available
,
the
accuracy
of
the
estimates
will
depend
on
the
effec-
tiveness
and
accuracy
of
the
estimation
procedures
or
models
employed
and
the
process
.
If
from
the
requirements
specifications
,
the
estimation
approach
can
produce
estimates
that
are
within
20
%
of
the
actual
effort
about
two-thirds
of
the
time
,
then
the
approach
can
be
considered
good
.
Here
we
discuss
two
commonly
used
approaches
.
Although
the
effort
for
a
project
is
a
function
of
many
parameters
,
it
is
generally
agreed
that
the
primary
factor
that
controls
the
effort
is
the
size
of
the
project
.
That
is
,
the
larger
the
project
,
the
greater
is
the
effort
requirement
.
The
top-
down
approach
utilizes
this
and
considers
effort
as
a
function
of
project
size
.
Note
that
to
use
this
approach
,
we
need
to
first
determine
the
nature
of
the
function
,
and
then
to
apply
the
function
,
we
need
to
estimate
the
size
of
the
project
for
which
effort
is
to
be
estimated
.
If
past
productivity
on
similar
projects
is
known
,
then
it
can
be
used
as
the
estimation
function
to
determine
effort
from
the
size
.
If
productivity
is
P
KLOC/PM
,
then
the
effort
estimate
for
the
project
will
be
SIZE/P
person-
months
.
Note
that
as
productivity
itself
depends
on
the
size
of
the
project
(
larger
projects
often
have
lower
productivity
)
,
this
approach
can
work
only
if
the
size
and
type
of
the
project
are
similar
to
the
set
of
projects
from
which
the
productivity
P
was
obtained
(
and
that
in
the
new
project
a
similar
productivity
can
be
obtained
by
following
a
process
similar
to
what
was
used
in
earlier
projects
)
.
A
more
general
function
for
determining
effort
from
size
that
is
commonly
used
is
of
the
form
:
where
a
and
b
are
constants
[
2
]
,
and
project
size
is
generally
in
KLOC
(
size
could
also
be
in
another
size
measure
called
function
points
which
can
be
de-
termined
from
requirements
)
.
Values
for
these
constants
for
an
organization
are
determined
through
regression
analysis
,
which
is
applied
to
data
about
the
projects
that
have
been
performed
in
the
past
.
For
example
,
Watson
and
Felix
[
81
]
analyzed
the
data
of
more
than
60
projects
done
at
IBM
Federal
Systems
Division
,
ranging
from
4000
to
467,000
lines
of
delivered
source
code
,
and
found
that
if
the
SIZE
estimate
is
in
thousands
of
delivered
lines
of
code
(
KLOC
)
,
the
total
effort
,
E
,
in
person-months
(
PM
)
can
be
given
by
the
equa-
tion
E
=
5.2
(
SIZE
)
.91
.
In
the
COnstructive
COst
MOdel
(
COCOMO
)
[
12
,
13
]
,
for
the
initial
estimate
(
also
called
nominal
estimate
)
the
equation
for
an
or-
ganic
project
is
E
=
3.9
(
SIZE
)
.91
.
Though
size
is
the
primary
factor
affecting
cost
,
other
factors
also
have
some
effect
.
In
the
COCOMO
model
,
after
determining
the
initial
estimate
,
some
other
factors
are
incorporated
for
obtaining
the
final
estimate
.
To
do
this
,
COCOMO
uses
a
set
of
1
.
Examples
of
the
attributes
are
required
software
reliability
,
product
complexity
,
analyst
capability
,
application
experience
,
use
of
modern
tools
,
and
required
development
schedule
.
Each
cost
driver
has
a
rating
scale
,
and
for
each
rating
,
a
multiplying
factor
is
provided
.
For
example
,
for
the
reliability
,
the
rating
scale
is
very
low
,
low
,
nominal
,
high
,
and
very
high
;
the
multiplying
factors
for
these
ratings
are
.75
,
.88
,
1.00
,
1.15
,
and
1.40
,
respectively
.
So
,
if
the
reliability
requirement
for
the
project
is
judged
to
be
low
,
then
the
multiplying
factor
is
.75
,
while
if
it
is
judged
to
be
very
high
,
the
factor
is
1.40
.
The
attributes
and
their
multiplying
factors
for
different
ratings
are
shown
in
Table
[
12
,
13
]
.
The
multiplying
factors
for
all
1
(
EAF
)
.
The
final
effort
estimate
,
E
,
is
obtained
by
multiplying
the
initial
estimate
by
the
EAF
.
In
other
words
,
adjustment
is
made
to
the
size-based
estimate
using
the
rating
for
these
1
.
As
an
example
,
consider
a
system
being
built
for
supporting
auctions
in
a
university
(
some
of
the
use
cases
of
this
were
discussed
in
the
previous
chapter
)
.
From
the
use
cases
and
other
requirements
,
it
is
decided
that
the
system
will
comprise
a
few
different
modules
.
The
modules
and
their
expected
sizes
are
:
The
total
size
of
this
software
is
estimated
to
be
.
If
we
want
to
use
COCOMO
for
estimation
,
we
should
estimate
the
value
of
the
different
cost
drivers
.
Suppose
we
expect
that
the
complexity
of
the
system
is
high
,
the
programmer
capability
is
low
,
and
the
application
experience
of
the
team
is
low
.
All
other
factors
have
a
nominal
rating
.
From
these
,
the
effort
adjustment
factor
(
EAF
)
is
The
initial
effort
estimate
for
the
project
is
obtained
from
the
relevant
equa-
tions
.
We
have
From
the
overall
estimate
,
estimates
of
the
effort
required
for
the
different
phases
in
the
projects
can
also
be
determined
.
This
is
generally
done
by
using
an
effort
distribution
among
phases
.
The
percentage
of
total
effort
spent
in
a
phase
varies
with
the
type
and
size
of
the
project
,
and
can
be
obtained
from
data
of
similar
projects
in
the
past
.
A
general
distribution
of
effort
among
different
phases
was
discussed
in
the
previous
chapter
.
The
effort
distribution
suggested
by
COCOMO
for
one
type
of
software
systems
is
given
in
Table
It
should
be
noted
that
to
use
the
top-down
approach
for
estimation
,
even
if
we
have
a
suitable
function
,
we
need
to
have
an
estimate
of
the
project
size
.
In
other
words
,
we
have
replaced
the
problem
of
effort
estimation
by
size
estimation
.
One
may
then
ask
,
why
not
directly
do
effort
estimation
rather
than
size
estimation
?
The
answer
is
that
size
estimation
is
often
easier
than
direct
effort
estimation
.
This
is
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
system
size
can
be
estimated
from
the
sizes
of
its
components
(
which
is
often
easier
to
do
)
by
adding
the
size
estimates
of
all
the
components
.
Similar
property
does
not
hold
for
effort
estimation
,
as
effort
for
developing
a
system
is
not
the
sum
of
effort
for
developing
the
components
(
as
additional
effort
is
needed
for
integration
and
other
such
activities
when
building
a
system
from
developed
components
)
.
Clearly
for
top-down
estimation
to
work
well
,
it
is
important
that
good
estimates
for
the
size
of
the
software
be
obtained
.
There
is
no
known
“
simple
”
method
for
estimating
the
size
accurately
.
When
estimating
software
size
,
the
best
way
may
be
to
get
as
much
detail
as
possible
about
the
software
to
be
developed
and
to
be
aware
of
our
biases
when
estimating
the
size
of
the
vari-
ous
components
.
By
obtaining
details
and
using
them
for
size
estimation
,
the
estimates
are
likely
to
be
closer
to
the
actual
size
of
the
final
software
.
A
somewhat
different
approach
for
effort
estimation
is
the
bottom-up
approach
.
In
this
approach
,
the
project
is
first
divided
into
tasks
and
then
estimates
for
the
different
tasks
of
the
project
are
obtained
.
From
the
estimates
of
the
different
tasks
,
the
overall
estimate
is
determined
.
That
is
,
the
overall
estimate
of
the
project
is
derived
from
the
estimates
of
its
parts
.
This
type
of
approach
is
also
called
activity-based
estimation
.
Essentially
,
in
this
approach
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
project
is
captured
in
the
set
of
tasks
the
project
has
to
perform
.
The
bottom-up
approach
lends
itself
to
direct
estimation
of
effort
;
once
the
project
is
partitioned
into
smaller
tasks
,
it
is
possible
to
directly
estimate
the
effort
required
for
them
,
especially
if
tasks
are
relatively
small
.
One
difficulty
in
this
approach
is
that
to
get
the
overall
estimate
,
all
the
tasks
have
to
be
enumerated
.
A
risk
of
bottom-up
methods
is
that
one
may
omit
some
activities
.
Also
,
directly
estimating
the
effort
for
some
overhead
tasks
,
such
as
project
management
,
that
span
the
project
can
be
difficult
.
If
architecture
of
the
system
to
be
built
has
been
developed
and
if
past
information
about
how
effort
is
distributed
over
different
phases
is
known
,
then
the
bottom-up
approach
need
not
completely
list
all
the
tasks
,
and
a
less
tedious
approach
is
possible
.
Here
we
describe
one
such
approach
used
in
a
commercial
organization
[
58
]
.
In
this
approach
,
the
major
programs
(
or
units
or
modules
)
in
the
software
being
built
are
first
determined
.
Each
program
unit
is
then
classified
as
simple
,
medium
,
or
complex
based
on
certain
criteria
.
For
each
classification
unit
,
an
average
effort
for
coding
(
and
unit
testing
)
is
decided
.
This
average
coding
effort
can
be
based
on
past
data
from
a
similar
project
,
from
some
guidelines
,
or
on
experience
of
people
.
Once
the
number
of
units
in
the
three
categories
of
complexity
is
known
and
the
estimated
coding
effort
for
each
program
is
selected
,
the
total
coding
effort
for
the
project
is
known
.
From
the
total
coding
effort
,
the
effort
required
for
the
other
phases
and
activities
in
the
project
is
determined
as
a
percentage
of
coding
effort
.
For
this
,
from
information
about
the
past
performance
of
the
process
,
the
likely
distribution
of
effort
in
different
phases
of
this
project
is
determined
.
This
distribution
is
then
used
to
determine
the
effort
for
other
phases
and
activities
from
the
effort
estimate
of
coding
.
From
these
estimates
,
the
total
effort
for
the
project
is
obtained
.
This
approach
lends
itself
to
a
judicious
mixture
of
experience
and
data
.
If
suitable
past
data
are
not
available
(
for
example
,
if
launching
a
new
type
of
project
)
,
one
can
estimate
the
coding
effort
using
experience
once
the
nature
of
the
different
types
of
units
is
specified
.
With
this
estimate
,
we
can
obtain
the
estimate
for
other
activities
by
working
with
some
reasonable
or
standard
effort
distribution
.
This
strategy
can
easily
account
for
activities
that
are
sometimes
difficult
to
enumerate
early
but
do
consume
effort
by
budgeting
effort
for
an
“
other
”
or
“
miscellaneous
”
category
.
The
procedure
for
estimation
can
be
summarized
as
the
following
sequence
of
steps
:
Identify
modules
in
the
system
and
classify
them
as
simple
,
medium
,
or
complex
.
Determine
the
average
coding
effort
for
simple/medium/complex
modules
.
Get
the
total
coding
effort
using
the
coding
effort
of
different
types
of
modules
and
the
counts
for
them
.
Using
the
effort
distribution
for
similar
projects
,
estimate
the
effort
for
other
tasks
and
the
total
effort
.
Refine
the
estimates
based
on
project-specific
factors
.
This
procedure
uses
a
judicious
mixture
of
past
data
(
in
the
form
of
dis-
tribution
of
effort
)
and
experience
of
the
programmers
.
This
approach
is
also
simple
and
similar
to
how
many
of
us
plan
any
project
.
For
this
reason
,
for
small
projects
,
many
people
find
this
approach
natural
and
comfortable
.
Note
that
this
method
of
classifying
programs
into
a
few
categories
and
us-
ing
an
average
coding
effort
for
each
category
is
used
only
for
effort
estimation
.
In
detailed
scheduling
,
when
a
project
manager
assigns
each
unit
to
a
member
of
the
team
for
coding
and
budgets
time
for
the
activity
,
characteristics
of
the
unit
are
taken
into
account
to
give
more
or
less
time
than
the
average
.
After
establishing
a
goal
on
the
effort
front
,
we
need
to
establish
the
goal
for
delivery
schedule
.
With
the
effort
estimate
(
in
person-months
)
,
it
may
be
tempting
to
pick
any
project
duration
based
on
convenience
and
then
fix
a
suitable
team
size
to
ensure
that
the
total
effort
matches
the
estimate
.
However
,
as
is
well
known
now
,
person
and
months
are
not
fully
interchangeable
in
a
software
project
.
Person
and
months
can
be
interchanged
arbitrarily
only
if
all
the
tasks
in
the
project
can
be
done
in
parallel
,
and
no
communication
is
needed
between
people
performing
the
tasks
.
This
is
not
true
for
software
projects—there
are
dependencies
between
tasks
(
e.g.
,
testing
can
only
be
done
after
coding
is
done
)
,
and
a
person
performing
some
task
in
a
project
needs
to
communicate
with
others
performing
other
tasks
.
As
Brooks
has
pointed
out
[
16
]
,
“
...
man
and
months
are
interchangeable
only
for
activities
that
require
no
communication
among
men
,
like
sowing
wheat
or
reaping
cotton
.
This
is
not
even
approximately
true
of
software
”
However
,
for
a
project
with
some
estimated
effort
,
multiple
schedules
(
or
project
duration
)
are
indeed
possible
.
For
example
,
for
a
project
whose
effort
estimate
is
5-months
,
a
total
schedule
of
.
A
schedule
of
,
as
is
a
schedule
of
approximately
.
(
But
a
schedule
of
5
.
Similarly
,
no
one
would
execute
the
project
in
2
.
)
In
other
words
,
once
the
effort
is
fixed
,
there
is
some
flexibility
in
setting
the
schedule
by
appropriately
staffing
the
project
,
but
this
flexibility
is
not
unlimited
.
Empirical
data
also
suggests
that
no
simple
equation
between
effort
and
schedule
fits
well
[
72
]
.
The
objective
is
to
fix
a
reasonable
schedule
that
can
be
achieved
(
if
suit-
able
number
of
resources
are
assigned
)
.
One
method
to
determine
the
overall
schedule
is
to
determine
it
as
a
function
of
effort
.
Such
function
can
be
de-
termined
from
data
from
completed
projects
using
statistical
techniques
like
fitting
a
regression
curve
through
the
scatter
plot
obtained
by
plotting
the
ef-
fort
and
schedule
of
past
projects
.
This
curve
is
generally
nonlinear
because
the
schedule
does
not
grow
linearly
with
effort
.
Many
models
follow
this
approach
[
2
,
12
]
.
The
IBM
Federal
Systems
Division
found
that
the
total
duration
,
M
,
in
calendar
months
can
be
estimated
by
M
=
4.1E.36
.
In
COCOMO
,
the
equation
for
schedule
for
an
organic
type
of
software
is
M
=
2.5E.38
.
As
schedule
is
not
a
function
solely
of
effort
,
the
schedule
determined
in
this
manner
is
essentially
a
guideline
.
Another
method
for
checking
a
schedule
for
medium-sized
projects
is
the
rule
of
thumb
called
the
square
root
check
[
58
]
.
This
check
suggests
that
the
proposed
schedule
can
be
around
the
square
root
of
the
total
effort
in
person-
months
.
This
schedule
can
be
met
if
suitable
resources
are
assigned
to
the
project
.
For
example
,
if
the
effort
estimate
is
50
person-months
,
a
schedule
of
about
.
From
this
macro
estimate
of
schedule
,
we
can
determine
the
schedule
for
the
major
milestones
in
the
project
.
To
determine
the
milestones
,
we
must
first
understand
the
manpower
ramp-up
that
usually
takes
place
in
a
project
.
The
number
of
people
that
can
be
gainfully
utilized
in
a
software
project
tends
to
follow
the
Rayleigh
curve
[
71
,
72
]
.
That
is
,
in
the
beginning
and
the
end
,
few
people
are
needed
on
the
project
;
the
peak
team
size
(
PTS
)
is
needed
somewhere
near
the
middle
of
the
project
;
and
again
fewer
people
are
needed
after
that
.
This
occurs
because
only
a
few
people
are
needed
and
can
be
used
in
the
initial
phases
of
requirements
analysis
and
design
.
The
human
resources
requirement
peaks
during
coding
and
unit
testing
,
and
during
system
testing
and
integration
,
again
fewer
people
are
required
.
Often
,
the
staffing
level
is
not
changed
continuously
in
a
project
and
ap-
proximations
of
the
Rayleigh
curve
are
used
:
assigning
a
few
people
at
the
start
,
having
the
peak
team
during
the
coding
phase
,
and
then
leaving
a
few
people
for
integration
and
system
testing
.
If
we
consider
design
and
analysis
,
build
,
and
test
as
three
major
phases
,
the
manpower
ramp-up
in
projects
typically
resembles
the
function
shown
in
Figure
[
58
]
.
For
ease
of
scheduling
,
particularly
for
smaller
projects
,
often
the
required
people
are
assigned
together
around
the
start
of
the
project
.
This
approach
can
lead
to
some
people
being
unoccupied
at
the
start
and
toward
the
end
.
This
slack
time
is
often
used
for
supporting
project
activities
like
training
and
documentation
.
Given
the
effort
estimate
for
a
phase
,
we
can
determine
the
duration
of
the
phase
if
we
know
the
manpower
ramp-up
.
For
these
three
major
phases
,
the
percentage
of
the
schedule
consumed
in
the
build
phase
is
smaller
than
the
percentage
of
the
effort
consumed
because
this
phase
involves
more
people
.
Similarly
,
the
percentage
of
the
schedule
consumed
in
the
design
and
testing
phases
exceeds
their
effort
percentages
.
The
exact
schedule
depends
on
the
planned
manpower
ramp-up
,
and
how
many
resources
can
be
used
effectively
in
a
phase
on
that
project
.
Generally
speaking
,
design
requires
about
a
quarter
of
the
schedule
,
build
consumes
about
half
,
and
integration
and
system
test-
ing
consume
the
remaining
quarter
.
COCOMO
gives
19
%
for
design
,
62
%
for
programming
,
and
18
%
for
integration
.
Having
set
the
goals
for
effort
and
schedule
,
the
goal
for
the
third
key
dimension
of
a
project—quality—needs
to
be
defined
.
However
,
unlike
schedule
and
effort
,
quantified
quality
goal
setting
for
a
project
and
then
planning
to
meet
it
is
much
harder
.
For
effort
and
schedule
goals
,
we
can
easily
check
if
a
detailed
plan
meets
these
goals
(
e.g.
,
by
seeing
if
the
last
task
ends
before
the
target
date
and
if
the
sum
total
of
effort
of
all
tasks
is
less
than
the
overall
effort
goal
)
.
For
quality
,
even
if
we
set
the
goal
in
terms
of
expected
delivered
defect
density
,
it
is
not
easy
to
plan
for
achieving
this
goal
or
for
checking
if
a
plan
can
meet
these
goals
.
Hence
,
often
,
quality
goals
are
specified
in
terms
of
acceptance
criteria—
the
delivered
software
should
finally
work
for
all
the
situations
and
test
cases
in
the
acceptance
criteria
.
Further
,
there
may
even
be
an
acceptance
criterion
on
the
number
of
defects
that
can
be
found
during
the
acceptance
testing
.
For
example
,
no
more
than
n
defects
are
uncovered
by
acceptance
testing
.
The
quality
plan
is
the
set
of
quality-related
activities
that
a
project
plans
to
do
to
achieve
the
quality
goal
.
To
plan
for
quality
,
let
us
first
understand
the
defect
injection
and
removal
cycle
,
as
it
is
defects
that
determine
the
quality
of
the
final
delivered
software
.
Software
development
is
a
highly
people-oriented
activity
and
hence
it
is
error-prone
.
In
a
software
project
,
we
start
with
no
defects
(
there
is
no
soft-
ware
to
contain
defects
)
.
Defects
are
injected
into
the
software
being
built
during
the
different
phases
in
the
project
.
That
is
,
during
the
transformation
from
user
needs
to
software
to
satisfy
those
needs
,
defects
are
injected
in
the
transformation
activities
undertaken
.
These
injection
stages
are
primarily
the
requirements
specification
,
the
high-level
design
,
the
detailed
design
,
and
cod-
ing
.
To
ensure
that
high-quality
software
is
delivered
,
these
defects
are
removed
through
the
quality
control
(
QC
)
activities
.
The
QC
activities
for
defect
re-
moval
include
requirements
reviews
,
design
reviews
,
code
reviews
,
unit
testing
,
integration
testing
,
system
testing
,
acceptance
testing
,
etc
.
Figure
shows
the
process
of
defect
injection
and
removal
.
As
the
final
goal
is
to
deliver
software
with
low
defect
density
,
ensuring
quality
revolves
around
two
main
themes
:
reduce
the
defects
being
injected
,
and
increase
the
defects
being
removed
.
The
first
is
often
done
through
standards
,
methodologies
,
following
of
good
processes
,
etc.
,
which
help
reduce
the
chances
of
errors
by
the
project
personnel
.
(
There
are
specific
techniques
for
defect
prevention
also
.
)
The
quality
plan
therefore
focuses
mostly
on
planning
suitable
quality
control
tasks
for
removing
defects
.
Reviews
and
testing
are
two
most
common
QC
activities
utilized
in
a
project
.
Whereas
reviews
are
structured
,
human-oriented
processes
,
testing
is
the
process
of
executing
software
(
or
parts
of
it
)
in
an
attempt
to
identify
de-
fects
.
The
most
common
approach
for
quality
planning
in
a
project
is
to
specify
the
QC
activities
to
be
performed
in
the
project
,
and
have
suitable
guidelines
for
performing
each
of
the
QC
tasks
,
such
that
the
chances
of
meeting
the
qual-
ity
goals
are
high
.
During
project
execution
,
these
activities
are
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
defined
procedures
.
When
this
approach
is
used
for
ensuring
quality
,
making
quantitative
claims
can
be
quite
hard
.
For
quantitative
assessment
of
the
quality
processes
,
metrics-based
analysis
is
necessary
.
That
,
however
,
is
an
advanced
topic
,
beyond
the
scope
of
this
book
(
and
indeed
many
organizations
)
.
Hence
,
for
ensuring
quality
,
the
reliance
is
primarily
on
applying
suitable
QC
techniques
at
the
right
places
in
the
process
,
and
using
experience
to
ensure
that
sufficient
QC
tasks
are
done
in
the
project
.
Hence
,
the
quality
plan
for
the
project
is
largely
a
specification
of
which
QC
task
is
to
be
done
and
when
,
and
what
process
and
guidelines
are
to
be
used
for
performing
the
QC
task
.
The
choice
depends
on
the
nature
and
goals
and
constraints
of
the
project
.
Typically
,
the
QC
tasks
will
be
schedulable
tasks
in
the
detailed
schedule
of
the
project
.
For
example
,
it
will
specify
what
documents
will
be
inspected
,
what
parts
of
the
code
will
be
inspected
,
and
what
levels
of
testing
will
be
performed
.
The
plan
can
be
considerably
enhanced
if
some
expectations
of
defect
levels
that
are
expected
to
be
found
for
the
different
quality
control
tasks
are
also
mentioned—these
can
then
aid
the
monitoring
of
quality
as
the
project
proceeds
.
A
software
project
is
a
complex
undertaking
.
Unforeseen
events
may
have
an
adverse
impact
on
a
project
’
s
ability
to
meet
the
cost
,
schedule
,
or
quality
goals
.
Risk
management
is
an
attempt
to
minimize
the
chances
of
failure
caused
by
unplanned
events
.
The
aim
of
risk
management
is
not
to
avoid
getting
into
projects
that
have
risks
but
to
minimize
the
impact
of
risks
in
the
projects
that
are
undertaken
.
A
risk
is
a
probabilistic
event—it
may
or
may
not
occur
.
For
this
reason
,
we
frequently
have
an
optimistic
tendency
to
simply
not
see
risks
or
to
hope
that
they
will
not
occur
.
Social
and
organizational
factors
also
may
stigmatize
risks
and
discourage
clear
identification
of
them
[
19
]
.
This
kind
of
attitude
gets
the
project
in
trouble
if
the
risk
events
materialize
,
something
that
is
likely
to
happen
in
a
large
project
.
Not
surprisingly
,
then
,
risk
management
is
considered
first
among
the
best
practices
for
managing
large
software
projects
[
17
]
.
It
first
came
to
the
forefront
with
Boehm
’
s
tutorial
on
risk
management
[
11
]
.
Since
then
,
several
books
have
targeted
risk
management
for
software
[
18
,
45
]
.
Risk
is
defined
as
an
exposure
to
the
chance
of
injury
or
loss
.
That
is
,
risk
implies
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
something
negative
may
happen
.
In
the
context
of
software
projects
,
negative
implies
that
there
is
an
adverse
effect
on
cost
,
quality
,
or
schedule
.
Risk
management
is
the
area
that
tries
to
ensure
that
the
impact
of
risks
on
cost
,
quality
,
and
schedule
is
minimal
.
Risk
management
can
be
considered
as
dealing
with
the
possibility
and
actual
occurrence
of
those
events
that
are
not
“
regular
”
or
commonly
expected
,
that
is
,
they
are
probabilistic
.
The
commonly
expected
events
,
such
as
people
going
on
leave
or
some
requirements
changing
,
are
handled
by
normal
project
management
.
So
,
in
a
sense
,
risk
management
begins
where
normal
project
management
ends
.
It
deals
with
events
that
are
infrequent
,
somewhat
out
of
the
control
of
the
project
management
,
and
which
can
have
a
major
impact
on
the
project
.
Most
projects
have
risk
.
The
idea
of
risk
management
is
to
minimize
the
possibility
of
risks
materializing
,
if
possible
,
or
to
minimize
the
effects
if
risks
actually
materialize
.
For
example
,
when
constructing
a
building
,
there
is
a
risk
that
the
building
may
later
collapse
due
to
an
earthquake
.
That
is
,
the
possibil-
ity
of
an
earthquake
is
a
risk
.
If
the
building
is
a
large
residential
complex
,
then
the
potential
cost
in
case
the
earthquake
risk
materializes
can
be
enormous
.
This
risk
can
be
reduced
by
shifting
to
a
zone
that
is
not
earthquake-prone
.
Alternatively
,
if
this
is
not
acceptable
,
then
the
effects
of
this
risk
materializing
are
minimized
by
suitably
constructing
the
building
(
the
approach
taken
in
Japan
and
California
)
.
At
the
same
time
,
if
a
small
dumping
ground
is
to
be
constructed
,
no
such
approach
might
be
followed
,
as
the
financial
and
other
impact
of
an
actual
earthquake
on
such
a
building
is
so
low
that
it
does
not
warrant
special
measures
.
It
should
be
clear
that
risk
management
has
to
deal
with
identifying
the
undesirable
events
that
can
occur
,
the
probability
of
their
occurring
,
and
the
loss
if
an
undesirable
event
does
occur
.
Once
this
is
known
,
strategies
can
be
formulated
for
either
reducing
the
probability
of
the
risk
materializing
or
re-
ducing
the
effect
of
risk
materializing
.
So
the
risk
management
revolves
around
risk
assessment
and
risk
control
.
The
goal
of
risk
assessment
is
to
prioritize
the
risks
so
that
attention
and
resources
can
be
focused
on
the
more
risky
items
.
Risk
identification
is
the
first
step
in
risk
assessment
,
which
identifies
all
the
different
risks
for
a
particular
project
.
These
risks
are
project-dependent
and
identifying
them
is
an
exercise
in
envisioning
what
can
go
wrong
.
Methods
that
can
aid
risk
identification
include
checklists
of
possible
risks
,
surveys
,
meetings
and
brainstorming
,
and
reviews
of
plans
,
processes
,
and
work
products
[
45
]
.
Checklists
of
frequently
occurring
risks
are
probably
the
most
common
tool
for
risk
identification—most
organizations
prepare
a
list
of
commonly
occurring
risks
for
projects
,
prepared
from
a
survey
of
previous
projects
.
Such
a
list
can
form
the
starting
point
for
identifying
risks
for
the
current
project
.
Based
on
surveys
of
experienced
project
managers
,
Boehm
[
11
]
has
produced
a
list
of
the
top
10
risk
items
likely
to
compromise
the
success
of
a
software
project
.
Figure
shows
some
of
these
risks
along
with
the
techniques
preferred
by
management
for
managing
these
risks
.
Top
risks
in
a
commercial
software
organization
can
be
found
in
[
58
]
.
The
top-ranked
risk
item
is
personnel
shortfalls
.
This
involves
just
having
fewer
people
than
necessary
or
not
having
people
with
specific
skills
that
a
project
might
require
.
Some
of
the
ways
to
manage
this
risk
are
to
get
the
top
talent
possible
and
to
match
the
needs
of
the
project
with
the
skills
of
the
available
personnel
.
Adequate
training
,
along
with
having
some
key
personnel
for
critical
areas
of
the
project
,
will
also
reduce
this
risk
.
The
second
item
,
unrealistic
schedules
and
budgets
,
happens
very
frequently
due
to
business
and
other
reasons
.
It
is
very
common
that
high-level
manage-
ment
imposes
a
schedule
for
a
software
project
that
is
not
based
on
the
char-
acteristics
of
the
project
and
is
unrealistic
.
Underestimation
may
also
happen
due
to
inexperience
or
optimism
.
The
next
few
items
are
related
to
requirements
.
Projects
run
the
risk
of
developing
the
wrong
software
if
the
requirements
analysis
is
not
done
properly
and
if
development
begins
too
early
.
Similarly
,
often
improper
user
interface
may
be
developed
.
This
requires
extensive
rework
of
the
user
interface
later
or
the
software
benefits
are
not
obtained
because
users
are
reluctant
to
use
it
.
Gold
plating
refers
to
adding
features
in
the
software
that
are
only
marginally
useful
.
This
adds
unnecessary
risk
to
the
project
because
gold
plating
consumes
resources
and
time
with
little
return
.
Risk
identification
merely
identifies
the
undesirable
events
that
might
take
place
during
the
project
,
i.e.
,
enumerates
the
“
unforeseen
”
events
that
might
occur
.
It
does
not
specify
the
probabilities
of
these
risks
materializing
nor
the
impact
on
the
project
if
the
risks
indeed
materialize
.
Hence
,
the
next
tasks
are
risk
analysis
and
prioritization
.
In
risk
analysis
,
the
probability
of
occurrence
of
a
risk
has
to
be
estimated
,
along
with
the
loss
that
will
occur
if
the
risk
does
materialize
.
This
is
often
done
through
discussion
,
using
experience
and
understanding
of
the
situation
,
though
structured
approaches
also
exist
.
Once
the
probabilities
of
risks
materializing
and
losses
due
to
materializa-
tion
of
different
risks
have
been
analyzed
,
they
can
be
prioritized
.
One
approach
for
prioritization
is
through
the
concept
of
risk
exposure
(
RE
)
[
11
]
,
which
is
sometimes
called
risk
impact
.
RE
is
defined
by
the
relationship
where
Prob
(
UO
)
is
the
probability
of
the
risk
materializing
(
i.e.
,
undesirable
outcome
)
and
Loss
(
UO
)
is
the
total
loss
incurred
due
to
the
unsatisfactory
outcome
.
The
loss
is
not
only
the
direct
financial
loss
that
might
be
incurred
but
also
any
loss
in
terms
of
credibility
,
future
business
,
and
loss
of
property
or
life
.
The
RE
is
the
expected
value
of
the
loss
due
to
a
particular
risk
.
For
risk
prioritization
using
RE
is
,
the
higher
the
RE
,
the
higher
the
priority
of
the
risk
item
.
The
main
objective
of
risk
management
is
to
identify
the
top
few
risk
items
and
then
focus
on
them
.
Once
a
project
manager
has
identified
and
prioritized
the
risks
,
the
top
risks
can
be
easily
identified
.
The
question
then
becomes
what
to
do
about
them
.
Knowing
the
risks
is
of
value
only
if
you
can
prepare
a
plan
so
that
their
consequences
are
minimal—that
is
the
basic
goal
of
risk
management
.
One
obvious
strategy
is
risk
avoidance
,
which
entails
taking
actions
that
will
avoid
the
risk
altogether
,
like
the
earlier
example
of
shifting
the
building
site
to
a
zone
that
is
not
earthquake-prone
.
For
some
risks
,
avoidance
might
be
possible
.
For
most
risks
,
the
strategy
is
to
perform
the
actions
that
will
either
reduce
the
probability
of
the
risk
materializing
or
reduce
the
loss
due
to
the
risk
materializing
.
These
are
called
risk
mitigation
steps
.
To
decide
what
mitigation
steps
to
take
,
a
list
of
commonly
used
risk
mitigation
steps
for
various
risks
is
very
useful
here
.
For
the
risks
mentioned
in
Figure
suitable
risk
mitigation
steps
are
also
given
.
Note
that
unlike
risk
assessment
,
which
is
largely
an
analytical
exercise
,
risk
mitigation
comprises
active
measures
that
have
to
be
performed
to
minimize
the
impact
of
risks
.
In
other
words
,
selecting
a
risk
mitigation
step
is
not
just
an
intellectual
exercise
.
The
risk
mitigation
step
must
be
executed
(
and
monitored
)
.
To
ensure
that
the
needed
actions
are
executed
properly
,
they
must
be
incorporated
into
the
detailed
project
schedule
.
Risk
prioritization
and
consequent
planning
are
based
on
the
risk
perception
at
the
time
the
risk
analysis
is
performed
.
Because
risks
are
probabilistic
events
that
frequently
depend
on
external
factors
,
the
threat
due
to
risks
may
change
with
time
as
factors
change
.
Clearly
,
then
,
the
risk
perception
may
also
change
with
time
.
Furthermore
,
the
risk
mitigation
steps
undertaken
may
affect
the
risk
perception
.
This
dynamism
implies
that
risks
in
a
project
should
not
be
treated
as
static
and
must
be
monitored
and
reevaluated
periodically
.
Hence
,
in
addition
to
monitoring
the
progress
of
the
planned
risk
mitigation
steps
,
a
project
must
periodically
revisit
the
risk
perception
and
modify
the
risk
mitigation
plans
,
if
needed
.
Risk
monitoring
is
the
activity
of
monitoring
the
status
of
various
risks
and
their
control
activities
.
One
simple
approach
for
risk
monitoring
is
to
analyze
the
risks
afresh
at
each
major
milestone
,
and
change
the
plans
as
needed
.
Though
the
concept
of
risk
exposure
is
rich
,
a
simple
practical
way
of
doing
risk
planning
is
to
simply
categorize
risks
and
the
impacts
in
a
few
levels
and
then
use
it
for
prioritization
.
This
approach
is
used
in
many
organizations
.
Here
we
discuss
a
simple
approach
used
in
an
organization
[
58
]
.
In
this
approach
,
the
probability
of
a
risk
occurring
is
categorized
as
low
,
medium
,
or
high
.
The
risk
impact
can
also
be
classified
as
low
,
medium
,
and
high
.
With
these
ratings
,
the
following
simple
method
for
risk
prioritization
can
be
specified
:
For
each
risk
,
rate
the
probability
of
its
happening
as
low
,
medium
,
or
high
.
For
each
risk
,
assess
its
impact
on
the
project
as
low
,
medium
,
or
high
.
Rank
the
risks
based
on
the
probability
and
effects
on
the
project
;
for
example
,
a
high-probability
,
high-impact
item
will
have
higher
rank
than
a
risk
item
with
a
medium
probability
and
high
impact
.
In
case
of
conflict
,
use
judgment
.
Select
the
top
few
risk
items
for
mitigation
and
tracking
.
An
example
of
this
approach
is
given
in
Table
which
shows
the
various
ratings
and
the
risk
mitigation
steps
[
58
]
.
As
we
can
see
,
the
risk
management
plan
,
which
is
essentially
this
table
,
can
be
very
brief
and
focused
.
For
moni-
toring
the
risks
,
one
way
is
to
redo
risk
management
planning
at
milestones
,
giving
more
attention
to
the
risks
listed
in
the
project
plan
.
During
risk
mon-
itoring
at
milestones
,
reprioritization
may
occur
and
mitigation
plans
for
the
remainder
of
the
project
may
change
,
depending
on
the
current
situation
and
the
impact
of
mitigation
steps
taken
earlier
.
A
project
management
plan
is
merely
a
document
that
can
be
used
to
guide
the
execution
of
a
project
.
Even
a
good
plan
is
useless
unless
it
is
properly
executed
.
And
execution
can
not
be
properly
driven
by
the
plan
unless
it
is
monitored
carefully
and
the
actual
performance
is
tracked
against
the
plan
.
Monitoring
requires
measurements
to
be
made
to
assess
the
situation
of
a
project
.
If
measurements
are
to
be
taken
during
project
execution
,
we
must
plan
carefully
regarding
what
to
measure
,
when
to
measure
,
and
how
to
measure
.
Hence
,
measurement
planning
is
a
key
element
in
project
planning
.
In
addition
,
how
the
measurement
data
will
be
analyzed
and
reported
must
also
be
planned
in
advance
to
avoid
the
situation
of
collecting
data
but
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
.
Without
careful
planning
for
data
collection
and
its
analysis
,
neither
is
likely
to
happen
.
In
this
section
we
discuss
the
issues
of
measurements
and
project
tracking
.
The
basic
purpose
of
measurements
in
a
project
is
to
provide
data
to
project
management
about
the
project
’
s
current
state
,
such
that
they
can
effectively
monitor
and
control
the
project
and
ensure
that
the
project
goals
are
met
.
As
project
goals
are
established
in
terms
of
software
to
be
delivered
,
cost
,
schedule
,
and
quality
,
for
monitoring
the
state
of
a
project
,
size
,
effort
,
schedule
,
and
defects
are
the
basic
measurements
that
are
needed
[
43
,
75
]
.
Schedule
is
one
of
the
most
important
metrics
because
most
projects
are
driven
by
schedules
and
deadlines
.
Only
by
monitoring
the
actual
schedule
can
we
properly
assess
if
the
project
is
on
time
or
if
there
is
a
delay
.
It
is
,
however
,
easy
to
measure
because
calendar
time
is
usually
used
in
all
plans
.
Effort
is
the
main
resource
consumed
in
a
software
project
.
Consequently
,
tracking
of
effort
is
a
key
activity
during
monitoring
;
it
is
essential
for
evaluating
whether
the
project
is
executing
within
budget
.
For
effort
data
some
type
of
timesheet
system
is
needed
where
each
person
working
on
the
project
enters
the
amount
of
time
spent
on
the
project
.
For
better
monitoring
,
the
effort
spent
on
various
tasks
should
be
logged
separately
.
Generally
effort
is
recorded
through
some
on-line
system
(
like
the
weekly
activity
report
system
in
[
57
]
)
,
which
allows
a
person
to
record
the
amount
of
time
spent
against
a
particular
activity
in
a
project
.
At
any
point
,
total
effort
on
an
activity
can
be
aggregated
.
Because
defects
have
a
direct
relationship
to
software
quality
,
tracking
of
defects
is
critical
for
ensuring
quality
.
A
large
software
project
may
include
thousands
of
defects
that
are
found
by
different
people
at
different
stages
.
Just
to
keep
track
of
the
defects
found
and
their
status
,
defects
must
be
logged
and
their
closure
tracked
.
If
defects
found
are
being
logged
,
monitoring
can
focus
on
how
many
defects
have
been
found
so
far
,
what
percentage
of
defects
are
still
open
,
and
other
issues
.
Defect
tracking
is
considered
one
of
the
best
practices
for
managing
a
project
[
17
]
.
Size
is
another
fundamental
metric
because
it
represents
progress
toward
delivering
the
desired
functionality
,
and
many
data
(
for
example
,
delivered
de-
fect
density
)
are
normalized
with
respect
to
size
.
The
size
of
delivered
software
can
be
measured
in
terms
of
LOC
(
which
can
be
determined
through
the
use
of
regular
editors
and
line
counters
)
or
function
points
.
At
a
more
gross
level
,
just
the
number
of
modules
or
number
of
features
might
suffice
.
For
effective
monitoring
,
a
project
must
plan
for
collecting
these
measure-
ments
.
Most
often
,
organizations
provide
tools
and
policy
support
for
recording
this
basic
data
,
which
is
then
available
to
project
managers
for
tracking
.
The
main
goal
of
project
managers
for
monitoring
a
project
is
to
get
visibility
into
the
project
execution
so
that
they
can
determine
whether
any
action
needs
to
be
taken
to
ensure
that
the
project
goals
are
met
.
As
project
goals
are
in
terms
of
effort
,
schedule
,
and
quality
,
the
focus
of
monitoring
is
on
these
aspects
.
Different
levels
of
monitoring
might
be
done
for
a
project
.
The
three
main
levels
of
monitoring
are
activity
level
,
status
reporting
,
and
milestone
analysis
.
Measurements
taken
on
the
project
are
employed
for
monitoring
.
Activity-level
monitoring
ensures
that
each
activity
in
the
detailed
schedule
has
been
done
properly
and
within
time
.
This
type
of
monitoring
may
be
done
daily
in
project
team
meetings
or
by
the
project
manager
checking
the
status
of
all
the
tasks
scheduled
to
be
completed
on
that
day
.
A
completed
task
is
often
marked
as
100
%
complete
in
detailed
schedule—this
is
used
by
tools
like
the
Microsoft
Project
to
track
the
percentage
completion
of
the
overall
project
or
a
higher-level
task
.
This
monitoring
is
to
ensure
that
the
project
continues
to
proceed
as
per
the
planned
schedule
.
Status
reports
are
often
prepared
weekly
to
take
stock
of
what
has
happened
and
what
needs
to
be
done
.
Status
reports
typically
contain
a
summary
of
the
activities
successfully
completed
since
the
last
status
report
,
any
activities
that
have
been
delayed
,
any
issues
in
the
project
that
need
attention
,
and
if
everything
is
in
place
for
the
next
week
.
Again
,
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
ensure
that
the
project
is
proceeding
as
per
the
planned
schedule
.
The
milestone
analysis
is
done
at
each
milestone
or
every
few
weeks
,
if
milestones
are
too
far
apart
,
and
is
more
elaborate
.
Analysis
of
actual
versus
estimated
for
effort
and
schedule
is
often
included
in
the
milestone
analysis
.
If
the
deviation
is
significant
,
it
may
imply
that
the
project
may
run
into
trouble
and
might
not
meet
its
objectives
.
This
situation
calls
for
project
managers
to
understand
the
reasons
for
the
variation
and
to
apply
corrective
and
preventive
actions
if
necessary
.
Defects
found
by
different
quality
control
tasks
,
and
the
number
of
defects
fixed
may
also
be
reported
.
This
report
monitors
the
progress
of
the
project
with
respect
to
all
the
goals
.
The
activities
discussed
so
far
result
in
a
project
management
plan
document
that
establishes
the
project
goals
for
effort
,
schedule
,
and
quality
;
and
defines
the
approach
for
risk
management
,
ensuring
quality
,
and
project
monitoring
.
Now
this
overall
plan
has
to
be
translated
into
a
detailed
action
plan
which
can
then
be
followed
in
the
project
,
and
which
,
if
followed
,
will
lead
to
a
successful
project
.
That
is
,
we
need
to
develop
a
detailed
plan
or
schedule
of
what
to
do
when
such
that
following
this
plan
will
lead
to
delivering
the
software
with
expected
quality
and
within
cost
and
schedule
.
Whereas
the
overall
planning
document
is
typically
prepared
at
the
start
of
the
project
and
is
relatively
static
,
the
detailed
plan
is
a
dynamic
document
that
reflects
the
current
plan
of
the
project
.
The
detailed
plan
is
what
assigns
work
items
to
individual
members
of
the
team
.
For
the
detailed
schedule
,
the
major
phases
identified
during
effort
and
schedule
estimation
,
are
broken
into
small
schedulable
activities
in
a
hierarchi-
cal
manner
.
For
example
,
the
detailed
design
phase
can
be
broken
into
tasks
for
developing
the
detailed
design
for
each
module
,
review
of
each
detailed
design
,
fixing
of
defects
found
,
and
so
on
.
For
each
detailed
task
,
the
project
manager
estimates
the
time
required
to
complete
it
and
assigns
a
suitable
resource
so
that
the
overall
schedule
is
met
,
and
the
overall
effort
also
matches
.
In
addition
to
the
engineering
tasks
that
are
the
outcome
of
the
development
process
,
the
QC
tasks
identified
in
the
quality
plan
,
the
monitoring
activities
defined
in
the
monitoring
plan
,
and
the
risk
mitigation
activities
should
also
be
scheduled
.
At
each
level
of
refinement
,
the
project
manager
determines
the
effort
for
the
overall
task
from
the
detailed
schedule
and
checks
it
against
the
effort
estimates
.
If
this
detailed
schedule
is
not
consistent
with
the
overall
schedule
and
effort
estimates
,
the
detailed
schedule
must
be
changed
.
If
it
is
found
that
the
best
detailed
schedule
can
not
match
the
milestone
effort
and
schedule
,
then
the
earlier
estimates
must
be
revised
.
Thus
,
scheduling
is
an
iterative
process
.
Generally
,
the
project
manager
refines
the
tasks
to
a
level
so
that
the
lowest-level
activity
can
be
scheduled
to
occupy
no
more
than
a
few
days
from
a
single
resource
.
Activities
related
to
tasks
such
as
project
management
,
co-
ordination
,
database
management
,
and
configuration
management
may
also
be
listed
in
the
schedule
,
even
though
these
activities
have
less
direct
effect
on
de-
termining
the
schedule
because
they
are
ongoing
tasks
rather
than
schedulable
activities
.
Nevertheless
,
they
consume
resources
and
hence
are
often
included
in
the
project
schedule
.
Rarely
will
a
project
manager
complete
the
detailed
schedule
of
the
entire
project
all
at
once
.
Once
the
overall
schedule
is
fixed
,
detailing
for
a
phase
may
only
be
done
at
the
start
of
that
phase
.
For
detailed
scheduling
,
tools
like
Microsoft
Project
or
a
spreadsheet
can
be
very
useful
.
For
each
lowest-level
activity
,
the
project
manager
specifies
the
effort
,
duration
,
start
date
,
end
date
,
and
resources
.
Dependencies
between
activities
,
due
either
to
an
inherent
dependency
(
for
example
,
you
can
conduct
a
unit
test
plan
for
a
program
only
after
it
has
been
coded
)
or
to
a
resource-
related
dependency
(
the
same
resource
is
assigned
two
tasks
)
,
may
also
be
specified
.
From
these
tools
the
overall
effort
and
schedule
of
higher-level
tasks
can
be
determined
.
A
detailed
project
schedule
is
never
static
.
Changes
may
be
needed
because
the
actual
progress
in
the
project
may
be
different
from
what
was
planned
,
because
newer
tasks
are
added
in
response
to
change
requests
,
or
because
of
other
unforeseen
situations
.
Changes
are
done
as
and
when
the
need
arises
.
The
final
schedule
,
frequently
maintained
using
some
suitable
tool
,
is
often
the
most
“
live
”
project
plan
document
.
During
the
project
,
if
plans
must
be
changed
and
additional
activities
must
be
done
,
after
the
decision
is
made
,
the
changes
must
be
reflected
in
the
detailed
schedule
,
as
this
reflects
the
tasks
actually
planned
to
be
performed
.
Hence
,
the
detailed
schedule
becomes
the
main
document
that
tracks
the
activities
and
schedule
.
It
should
be
noted
that
only
the
number
of
resources
is
decided
during
the
overall
project
planning
.
However
,
detailed
scheduling
can
be
done
effec-
tively
only
after
actual
assignment
of
people
has
been
done
,
as
task
assignment
needs
information
about
the
capabilities
of
the
team
members
.
In
our
discus-
sion
above
,
we
have
implicitly
assumed
that
the
project
’
s
team
is
led
by
a
project
manager
,
who
does
the
planning
and
task
assignment
.
This
form
of
hi-
erarchical
team
organization
is
fairly
common
,
and
was
earlier
called
the
Chief
Programmer
Team
.
As
an
example
,
consider
the
example
of
a
project
from
[
58
]
.
The
overall
effort
estimate
for
this
project
is
50-days
,
or
about
2-months
(
this
estimation
was
done
using
the
bottom-up
approach
discussed
earlier
)
.
The
customer
gave
approximately
5
..
Because
this
is
more
than
the
square
root
of
effort
in
person-months
,
this
schedule
was
accepted
.
Hence
,
these
define
the
effort
and
schedule
goals
of
the
project
.
The
milestones
are
determined
by
using
the
effort
estimates
for
the
phases
and
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
resources
available
.
Table
shows
the
high-
level
schedule
of
the
project
.
This
project
uses
the
RUP
process
in
which
initial
requirement
and
design
is
done
in
two
iterations
and
the
development
is
done
in
three
iterations
.
The
overall
project
duration
with
these
milestones
is
140
days
.
This
high-level
schedule
is
an
outcome
of
the
overall
project
planning
,
and
is
not
suitable
for
assigning
resources
and
detailed
planning
.
For
detailed
scheduling
,
these
tasks
are
broken
into
schedulable
activities
.
In
this
way
,
the
schedule
also
becomes
a
checklist
of
tasks
for
the
project
.
As
mentioned
above
,
this
exploding
of
top-level
activities
is
not
done
fully
at
the
start
but
rather
takes
place
many
times
during
the
project
.
Table
shows
part
of
the
detailed
schedule
of
the
construction-iteration
.
For
each
activity
,
the
table
specifies
the
activity
by
a
short
name
,
the
module
to
which
the
activity
is
contributing
,
and
the
effort
(
the
duration
may
also
be
specified
)
.
For
each
task
,
how
much
is
completed
is
given
in
the
%
Complete
column
.
This
information
is
used
for
activity
tracking
.
The
detailed
schedule
also
specifies
the
resource
to
which
the
task
is
assigned
(
specified
by
initials
of
the
person
)
.
Sometimes
,
the
predecessors
of
the
activity
(
the
activities
upon
which
the
task
depends
)
are
also
specified
.
This
information
helps
in
determining
the
critical
path
and
the
critical
resources
.
This
project
finally
had
a
total
of
about
32
.
Project
planning
serves
two
purposes
:
to
set
the
overall
goals
or
expectations
for
the
project
and
the
overall
approach
for
managing
the
project
,
and
to
schedule
tasks
to
be
done
such
that
the
goals
are
met
.
In
overall
planning
,
effort
and
schedule
estimation
are
done
to
establish
the
cost
and
schedule
goals
for
the
project
as
well
as
key
milestones
.
Project
quality
planning
and
risk
management
planning
establish
approaches
for
achieving
quality
goals
and
ensuring
that
the
project
does
not
fail
in
the
face
of
risks
.
In
the
detailed
schedule
,
tasks
for
achieving
each
milestone
are
identified
and
scheduled
to
be
executed
by
specific
team
members
such
that
the
overall
schedule
and
effort
for
different
milestones
is
met
.
In
a
top-down
approach
for
estimating
effort
for
the
project
,
the
effort
is
estimated
from
the
size
estimate
,
which
may
be
refined
using
other
char-
acteristics
of
the
project
.
Effort
for
different
phases
is
determined
from
the
overall
effort
using
effort
distribution
data
.
COCOMO
is
one
model
that
uses
this
approach
.
In
a
bottom-up
approach
to
estimation
,
the
modules
to
be
built
are
identified
first
,
and
then
using
an
average
effort
for
coding
such
modules
,
the
overall
coding
effort
is
determined
.
From
coding
effort
,
effort
for
other
phases
and
overall
project
are
determined
,
using
the
effort
distribution
data
.
Some
flexibility
exists
in
setting
the
schedule
goal
for
a
project
.
An
overall
schedule
can
be
determined
as
a
function
of
effort
,
and
then
adjusted
to
meet
the
project
needs
and
constraints
.
Once
a
reasonable
schedule
is
chosen
,
the
staffing
requirements
of
the
project
are
determined
using
the
project
’
s
effort
.
Schedule
for
milestones
are
determined
from
effort
estimates
and
the
effective
team
size
in
different
phases
.
With
estimation
and
scheduling
,
the
effort
and
schedule
goals
for
the
project
are
established
.
Setting
measurable
quality
goals
for
a
project
is
harder
.
The
quality
goal
can
be
set
in
terms
of
performance
during
acceptance
testing
.
A
quality
plan
consists
of
quality
control
tasks
that
should
be
performed
in
the
project
to
achieve
the
quality
goal
.
A
project
can
have
risks
,
and
to
meet
project
goals
under
the
presence
of
risks
requires
proper
risk
management
.
Risks
are
those
events
which
may
or
may
not
occur
,
but
if
they
do
occur
,
they
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
project
.
Risks
can
be
prioritized
based
on
the
expected
loss
from
a
risk
,
which
is
a
combination
of
the
probability
of
the
risk
and
the
total
possible
loss
due
to
risk
materializing
.
For
high-priority
risks
,
activities
are
planned
during
normal
project
execution
such
that
if
the
risks
do
materialize
,
their
effect
is
minimal
.
The
progress
of
the
project
needs
to
be
monitored
using
suitable
measure-
ments
so
corrective
actions
can
be
taken
,
when
needed
.
The
measurements
commonly
used
for
monitoring
are
actual
schedule
,
effort
consumed
,
defects
found
,
and
the
size
of
the
product
.
Status
reports
and
milestone
reports
on
actual
vs.
estimated
on
effort
and
schedule
,
activities
that
got
missed
,
defects
found
so
far
,
and
risks
,
can
suffice
to
effectively
monitor
the
performance
of
a
project
with
respect
to
its
plan
.
The
overall
project
management
plan
document
containing
the
effort
,
sched-
ule
,
and
quality
goals
,
and
plans
for
quality
,
monitoring
,
and
risk
manage-
ment
,
sets
the
overall
context
.
For
execution
,
the
overall
schedule
is
broken
into
a
detailed
schedule
of
tasks
to
be
done
so
as
to
meet
the
goals
and
constraints
.
These
tasks
are
assigned
to
specific
team
members
,
with
identified
start
and
end
dates
.
The
sched-
ule
has
to
be
such
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
overall
schedule
and
effort
estimates
.
Tasks
planned
for
quality
,
monitoring
,
and
risk
management
are
also
scheduled
in
the
detailed
schedule
.
This
detailed
schedule
lays
out
the
path
the
project
should
follow
in
order
to
achieve
the
project
objectives
.
It
is
the
most
live
project
planning
document
and
any
changes
in
the
project
plan
must
be
reflected
suitably
in
the
detailed
schedule
.
What
is
the
role
of
effort
estimation
in
a
project
,
and
why
is
it
important
to
do
this
estimation
early
?
If
an
architecture
of
the
proposed
system
has
been
designed
specifying
the
major
components
in
the
system
,
and
you
have
source
code
of
similar
components
avail-
able
in
your
organization
’
s
repository
,
which
method
will
you
use
for
estimation
?
Suppose
an
organization
plans
to
use
COCOMO
for
effort
estimation
,
but
it
wants
to
use
only
three
cost
drivers—product
complexity
,
programmer
capability
,
and
development
schedule
.
In
this
situation
,
from
the
initial
estimate
,
by
how
much
can
the
final
estimate
vary
?
Why
are
all
combinations
of
people
and
months
that
are
consistent
with
the
effort
estimate
not
feasible
?
A
customer
asks
you
to
complete
a
project
,
whose
effort
estimate
is
E
,
in
time
T
.
How
will
you
decide
whether
to
accept
this
schedule
or
not
?
For
a
group
student
project
being
done
in
a
semester
course
,
list
the
major
risks
that
a
typical
project
will
face
,
and
risk
mitigation
strategy
for
the
high-priority
risks
.
Suppose
you
make
a
detailed
schedule
for
your
project
whose
effort
and
schedule
estimates
for
various
milestones
have
been
done
in
the
project
plan
.
How
will
you
check
if
the
detailed
schedule
is
consistent
with
the
overall
plan
?
What
will
you
do
if
it
is
not
?
Any
complex
system
is
composed
of
subsystems
that
interact
under
the
control
of
system
design
such
that
the
system
provides
the
expected
behavior
.
When
designing
such
a
system
,
therefore
,
the
logical
approach
is
to
identify
the
sub-
systems
that
should
compose
the
system
,
the
interfaces
of
these
subsystems
,
and
the
rules
for
interaction
between
the
subsystems
.
This
is
what
software
architecture
aims
to
do
.
Software
architecture
is
a
relatively
recent
area
.
As
the
software
systems
increasingly
become
distributed
and
more
complex
,
architecture
becomes
an
important
step
in
building
the
system
.
Due
to
a
wide
range
of
options
now
available
for
how
a
system
may
be
configured
and
connected
,
carefully
de-
signing
the
architecture
becomes
very
important
.
It
is
during
the
architecture
design
where
choices
like
using
some
type
of
middleware
,
or
some
type
of
back-
end
database
,
or
some
type
of
server
,
or
some
type
of
security
component
are
made
.
Architecture
is
also
the
earliest
place
when
properties
like
reliability
and
performance
can
be
evaluated
for
the
system
,
a
capability
that
is
increasingly
becoming
important
.

A
Concise
Introduction

Software
Engineering
,
Different
styles
that
have
been
proposed
for
component
and
connector
view
that
can
be
used
to
design
the
architecture
of
the
proposed
system
.
What
is
architecture
?
Generally
speaking
,
architecture
of
a
system
provides
a
very
high
level
view
of
the
parts
of
the
system
and
how
they
are
related
to
form
the
whole
system
.
That
is
,
architecture
partitions
the
system
in
logical
parts
such
that
each
part
can
be
comprehended
independently
,
and
then
describes
the
system
in
terms
of
these
parts
and
the
relationship
between
these
parts
.
Any
complex
system
can
be
partitioned
in
many
different
ways
,
each
pro-
viding
a
useful
view
and
each
having
different
types
of
logical
parts
.
The
same
holds
true
for
a
software
system—there
is
no
unique
structure
of
the
system
that
can
be
described
by
its
architecture
;
there
are
many
possible
structures
.
Due
to
this
possibility
of
having
multiple
structures
,
one
of
the
most
widely
accepted
definitions
of
software
architecture
is
that
the
software
architecture
of
a
system
is
the
structure
or
structures
of
the
system
,
which
comprise
software
el-
ements
,
the
externally
visible
properties
of
those
elements
,
and
the
relationships
among
them
[
6
]
.
This
definition
implies
that
for
elements
in
an
architecture
,
we
are
only
interested
in
those
abstractions
that
specify
those
properties
that
other
elements
can
assume
to
exist
and
that
are
needed
to
specify
relationships
.
Details
on
how
these
properties
are
supported
are
not
needed
for
architecture
.
This
is
an
important
capability
that
allows
architecture
descriptions
to
repre-
sent
a
complex
system
in
a
succinct
form
that
is
easily
comprehended
.
An
architecture
description
of
a
system
will
therefore
describe
the
different
structures
of
the
system
.
The
next
natural
question
is
why
should
a
team
building
a
software
system
for
some
customer
be
interested
in
creating
and
documenting
the
structures
of
the
proposed
system
.
Some
of
the
important
uses
that
software
architecture
descriptions
play
are
[
6
,
23
,
54
]
:
Understanding
and
communication
.
An
architecture
description
is
primar-
ily
to
communicate
the
architecture
to
its
various
stakeholders
,
which
in-
clude
the
users
who
will
use
the
system
,
the
clients
who
commissioned
the
system
,
the
builders
who
will
build
the
system
,
and
,
of
course
,
the
archi-
tects
.
Through
this
description
the
stakeholders
gain
an
understanding
of
some
macro
properties
of
the
system
and
how
the
system
intends
to
ful-
fill
the
functional
and
quality
requirements
.
As
the
description
provides
a
common
language
between
stakeholders
,
it
also
becomes
the
vehicle
for
negotiation
and
agreement
among
the
stakeholders
,
who
may
have
conflict-
ing
goals
.
Reuse
.
The
software
engineering
world
has
,
for
a
long
time
,
been
working
toward
a
discipline
where
software
can
be
assembled
from
parts
that
are
developed
by
different
people
and
are
available
for
others
to
use
.
If
one
wants
to
build
a
software
product
in
which
existing
components
may
be
reused
,
then
architecture
becomes
the
key
point
at
which
reuse
at
the
high-
est
level
is
decided
.
The
architecture
has
to
be
chosen
in
a
manner
such
that
the
components
which
have
to
be
reused
can
fit
properly
and
together
with
other
components
that
may
be
developed
.
Architecture
also
facili-
tates
reuse
among
products
that
are
similar
and
building
product
families
such
that
the
common
parts
of
these
different
but
similar
products
can
be
reused
.
Architecture
helps
specify
what
is
fixed
and
what
is
variable
in
these
different
products
,
and
can
help
minimize
the
set
of
variable
elements
such
that
different
products
can
share
software
parts
to
the
maximum
.
Again
,
it
is
very
hard
to
achieve
this
type
of
reuse
at
a
detail
level
.
Construction
and
Evolution
.
As
architecture
partitions
the
system
into
parts
,
some
architecture-provided
partitioning
can
naturally
be
used
for
constructing
the
system
,
which
also
requires
that
the
system
be
broken
into
parts
such
that
different
teams
(
or
individuals
)
can
separately
work
on
different
parts
.
A
suitable
partitioning
in
the
architecture
can
provide
the
project
with
the
parts
that
need
to
be
built
to
build
the
system
.
As
,
almost
by
definition
,
the
parts
specified
in
an
architecture
are
relatively
indepen-
dent
(
the
dependence
between
parts
coming
through
their
relationship
)
,
they
can
be
built
independently
.
Analysis
.
It
is
highly
desirable
if
some
important
properties
about
the
be-
havior
of
the
system
can
be
determined
before
the
system
is
actually
built
.
This
will
allow
the
designers
to
consider
alternatives
and
select
the
one
that
will
best
suit
the
needs
.
Many
engineering
disciplines
use
models
to
analyze
design
of
a
product
for
its
cost
,
reliability
,
performance
,
etc
.
Archi-
tecture
opens
such
possibilities
for
software
also
.
It
is
possible
(
though
the
methods
are
not
fully
developed
or
standardized
yet
)
to
analyze
or
predict
the
properties
of
the
system
being
built
from
its
architecture
.
For
exam-
ple
,
the
reliability
or
the
performance
of
the
system
can
be
analyzed
.
Such
an
analysis
can
help
determine
whether
the
system
will
meet
the
quality
and
performance
requirements
,
and
if
not
,
what
needs
to
be
done
to
meet
the
requirements
.
For
example
,
while
building
a
website
for
shopping
,
it
is
possible
to
analyze
the
response
time
or
throughput
for
a
proposed
archi-
tecture
,
given
some
assumptions
about
the
request
load
and
hardware
.
It
can
then
be
decided
whether
the
performance
is
satisfactory
or
not
,
and
if
not
,
what
new
capabilities
should
be
added
(
for
example
,
a
different
archi-
tecture
or
a
faster
server
for
the
back
end
)
to
improve
it
to
a
satisfactory
level
.
Not
all
of
these
uses
may
be
significant
in
a
project
and
which
of
these
uses
is
pertinent
to
a
project
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
project
.
In
some
projects
communication
may
be
very
important
,
but
a
detailed
performance
analysis
may
be
unnecessary
(
because
the
system
is
too
small
or
is
meant
for
only
a
few
users
)
.
In
some
other
systems
,
performance
analysis
may
be
the
primary
use
of
architecture
.
There
is
a
general
view
emerging
that
there
is
no
unique
architecture
of
a
system
.
The
definition
that
we
have
adopted
(
given
above
)
also
expresses
this
sentiment
.
Consequently
,
there
is
no
one
architecture
drawing
of
the
system
.
The
situation
is
similar
to
that
of
civil
construction
,
a
discipline
that
is
the
original
user
of
the
concept
of
architecture
and
from
where
the
concept
of
software
architecture
has
been
borrowed
.
For
a
building
,
if
you
want
to
see
the
floor
plan
,
you
are
shown
one
set
of
drawings
.
If
you
are
an
electrical
engineer
and
want
to
see
how
the
electricity
distribution
has
been
planned
,
you
will
be
shown
another
set
of
drawings
.
And
if
you
are
interested
in
safety
and
firefighting
,
another
set
of
drawings
is
used
.
These
drawings
are
not
independent
of
each
other—they
are
all
about
the
same
building
.
However
,
each
drawing
provides
a
different
view
of
the
building
,
a
view
that
focuses
on
explaining
one
aspect
of
the
building
and
tries
to
a
good
job
at
that
,
while
not
divulging
much
about
the
other
aspects
.
And
no
one
drawing
can
express
all
the
different
aspects—such
a
drawing
will
be
too
complex
to
be
of
any
use
.
Similar
is
the
situation
with
software
architecture
.
In
software
,
the
different
drawings
are
called
views
.
A
view
represents
the
system
as
composed
of
some
types
of
elements
and
relationships
between
them
.
Which
elements
are
used
by
a
view
,
depends
on
what
the
view
wants
to
highlight
.
Different
views
expose
different
properties
and
attributes
,
thereby
allowing
the
stakeholders
and
ana-
lysts
to
properly
evaluate
those
attributes
for
the
system
.
By
focusing
only
on
some
aspects
of
the
system
,
a
view
reduces
the
complexity
that
a
reader
has
to
deal
with
at
a
time
,
thereby
aiding
system
understanding
and
analysis
.
A
view
describes
a
structure
of
the
system
.
We
will
use
these
two
concepts—
views
and
structures—interchangeably
.
We
will
also
use
the
term
architectural
view
to
refer
to
a
view
.
Many
types
of
views
have
been
proposed
.
Most
of
the
proposed
views
generally
belong
to
one
of
these
three
types
[
6
,
23
]
:
In
a
module
view
,
the
system
is
viewed
as
a
collection
of
code
units
,
each
implementing
some
part
of
the
system
functionality
.
That
is
,
the
main
elements
in
this
view
are
modules
.
These
views
are
code-based
and
do
not
explicitly
rep-
resent
any
runtime
structure
of
the
system
.
Examples
of
modules
are
packages
,
a
class
,
a
procedure
,
a
method
,
a
collection
of
functions
,
and
a
collection
of
classes
.
The
relationships
between
these
modules
are
also
code-based
and
de-
pend
on
how
code
of
a
module
interacts
with
another
module
.
Examples
of
relationships
in
this
view
are
“
is
a
part
of
”
(
i.e.
,
module
B
is
a
part
of
module
A
)
,
“
uses
or
depends
on
”
(
a
module
A
uses
services
of
module
B
to
perform
its
own
functions
and
correctness
of
module
A
depends
on
correctness
of
module
B
)
,
and
“
generalization
or
specialization
”
(
a
module
B
is
a
generalization
of
a
module
A
)
.
In
a
component
and
connector
(
C
&
C
)
view
,
the
system
is
viewed
as
a
col-
lection
of
runtime
entities
called
components
.
That
is
,
a
component
is
a
unit
which
has
an
identity
in
the
executing
system
.
Objects
(
not
classes
)
,
a
collec-
tion
of
objects
,
and
a
process
are
examples
of
components
.
While
executing
,
components
need
to
interact
with
others
to
support
the
system
services
.
Con-
nectors
provide
means
for
this
interaction
.
Examples
of
connectors
are
pipes
and
sockets
.
Shared
data
can
also
act
as
a
connector
.
If
the
components
use
some
middleware
to
communicate
and
coordinate
,
then
the
middleware
is
a
connector
.
Hence
,
the
primary
elements
of
this
view
are
components
and
con-
nectors
.
An
allocation
view
focuses
on
how
the
different
software
units
are
allocated
to
resources
like
the
hardware
,
file
systems
,
and
people
.
That
is
,
an
allocation
view
specifies
the
relationship
between
software
elements
and
elements
of
the
environments
in
which
the
software
system
is
executed
.
They
expose
structural
properties
like
which
processes
run
on
which
processor
,
and
how
the
system
files
are
organized
on
a
file
system
.
An
architecture
description
consists
of
views
of
different
types
,
with
each
view
exposing
some
structure
of
the
system
.
Module
views
show
how
the
soft-
ware
is
structured
as
a
set
of
implementation
units
,
C
&
C
views
show
how
the
software
is
structured
as
interacting
runtime
elements
,
and
allocation
views
show
how
software
relates
to
nonsoftware
structures
.
These
three
types
of
view
of
the
same
system
form
the
architecture
of
the
system
.
Note
that
the
different
views
are
not
unrelated
.
They
all
represent
the
same
system
.
Hence
,
there
are
relationships
between
elements
in
one
view
and
ele-
ments
in
another
view
.
These
relationships
may
be
simple
or
may
be
complex
.
For
example
,
the
relationship
between
modules
and
components
may
be
one
to
one
in
that
one
module
implements
one
component
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
may
be
quite
complex
with
a
module
being
used
by
multiple
components
,
and
a
component
using
multiple
modules
.
While
creating
the
different
views
,
the
designers
have
to
be
aware
of
this
relationship
.
The
next
question
is
what
are
the
standard
views
that
should
be
expressed
for
describing
the
architecture
of
a
system
?
To
answer
this
question
,
the
analogy
with
buildings
may
again
help
.
If
one
is
building
a
simple
small
house
,
then
perhaps
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
separate
view
describing
the
emergency
and
the
fire
system
.
Similarly
,
if
there
is
no
air
conditioning
in
the
building
,
there
need
not
be
any
view
for
that
.
On
the
other
hand
,
an
office
building
will
perhaps
require
both
of
these
views
,
in
addition
to
other
views
describing
plumbing
,
space
,
wiring
,
etc
.
However
,
despite
the
fact
that
there
are
multiple
drawings
showing
different
views
of
a
building
,
there
is
one
view
that
predominates
in
construction—that
of
physical
structure
.
This
view
forms
the
basis
of
other
views
in
that
other
views
can
not
really
be
completed
unless
this
view
can
be
done
.
Other
views
may
or
may
not
be
needed
for
constructing
a
building
,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
project
.
Hence
,
in
a
sense
,
the
view
giving
the
building
structure
may
be
considered
as
the
primary
view
in
that
it
is
almost
always
used
,
and
other
views
rely
on
this
view
substantially
.
The
view
also
captures
perhaps
the
most
important
property
to
be
analyzed
in
the
early
stages
,
namely
,
that
of
space
organization
.
The
situation
with
software
architecture
is
also
somewhat
similar
.
As
we
have
said
,
depending
on
what
properties
are
of
interest
,
different
views
of
the
software
architecture
are
needed
.
However
,
of
these
views
,
the
C
&
C
view
has
become
the
defacto
primary
view
,
one
which
is
almost
always
prepared
when
an
architecture
is
designed
(
some
definitions
even
view
architecture
only
in
terms
of
C
&
C
views
)
.
In
this
chapter
,
we
will
focus
primarily
on
the
C
&
C
view
.
A
note
about
relationship
between
architecture
and
design
is
in
order
.
As
partitioning
a
system
into
smaller
parts
and
composing
the
system
from
these
parts
is
also
a
goal
of
design
,
a
natural
question
is
what
is
the
difference
between
a
design
and
architecture
as
both
aim
to
achieve
similar
objectives
and
seem
to
fundamentally
rely
on
the
divide
and
conquer
rule
?
First
,
it
should
be
clear
that
architecture
is
a
design
in
that
it
is
in
the
solution
domain
and
talks
about
the
structure
of
the
proposed
system
.
Furthermore
,
an
architecture
view
gives
a
high-level
view
of
the
system
,
relying
on
abstraction
to
convey
the
meaning—
something
which
design
also
does
.
So
,
architecture
is
design
.
We
can
view
architecture
as
a
very
high-level
design
,
focusing
only
on
main
components
,
and
the
architecture
activity
as
the
first
step
in
design
.
What
we
term
as
design
is
really
about
the
modules
that
will
eventually
exist
as
code
.
That
is
,
they
are
a
more
concrete
representation
of
the
implementation
(
though
not
yet
an
implementation
)
.
Consequently
,
during
design
lower-level
issues
like
the
data
structures
,
files
,
and
sources
of
data
,
have
to
be
addressed
,
while
such
issues
are
not
generally
significant
at
the
architecture
level
.
We
also
take
the
view
that
design
can
be
considered
as
providing
the
module
view
of
the
architecture
of
the
system
.
The
boundaries
between
architecture
and
high-level
design
are
not
fully
clear
.
The
way
the
field
has
evolved
,
we
can
say
that
the
line
between
architec-
ture
and
design
is
really
up
to
the
designer
or
the
architect
.
At
the
architecture
level
,
one
needs
to
show
only
those
parts
that
are
needed
to
perform
the
desired
evaluation
.
The
internal
structure
of
these
parts
is
not
important
.
On
the
other
hand
,
during
design
,
designing
the
structure
of
the
parts
that
can
lead
to
con-
structing
them
is
one
of
the
key
tasks
.
However
,
which
parts
of
the
structure
should
be
examined
and
revealed
during
architecture
and
which
parts
during
design
is
a
matter
of
choice
.
Generally
speaking
,
details
that
are
not
needed
to
perform
the
types
of
analysis
we
wish
to
do
at
the
architecture
time
are
unnecessary
and
should
be
left
for
design
to
uncover
.
The
C
&
C
architecture
view
of
a
system
has
two
main
elements—components
and
connectors
.
Components
are
usually
computational
elements
or
data
stores
that
have
some
presence
during
the
system
execution
.
Connectors
define
the
means
of
interaction
between
these
components
.
A
C
&
C
view
of
the
system
de-
fines
the
components
,
and
which
component
is
connected
to
which
and
through
what
connector
.
A
C
&
C
view
describes
a
runtime
structure
of
the
system—
what
components
exist
when
the
system
is
executing
and
how
they
interact
during
the
execution
.
The
C
&
C
structure
is
essentially
a
graph
,
with
compo-
nents
as
nodes
and
connectors
as
edges
.
The
C
&
C
view
is
perhaps
the
most
common
view
of
architecture
and
most
box-and-line
drawings
representing
architecture
attempt
to
capture
this
view
.
Most
often
when
people
talk
about
the
architecture
,
they
refer
to
the
C
&
C
view
.
Most
architecture
description
languages
also
focus
on
the
C
&
C
view
.
Components
are
generally
units
of
computation
or
data
stores
in
the
system
.
A
component
has
a
name
,
which
is
generally
chosen
to
represent
the
role
of
the
component
or
the
function
it
performs
.
The
name
also
provides
a
unique
identity
to
the
component
,
which
is
necessary
for
referencing
details
about
the
component
in
the
supporting
documents
,
as
a
C
&
C
drawing
will
only
show
the
component
names
.
A
component
is
of
a
component
type
,
where
the
type
represents
a
generic
component
,
defining
the
general
computation
and
the
interfaces
a
component
of
that
type
must
have
.
Note
that
though
a
component
has
a
type
,
in
the
C
&
C
architecture
view
,
we
have
components
(
i.e.
,
actual
instances
)
and
not
types
.
Examples
of
these
types
are
clients
,
servers
,
filters
,
etc
.
Different
domains
may
have
other
generic
types
like
controllers
,
actuators
,
and
sensors
(
for
a
control
system
domain
)
.
In
a
diagram
representing
a
C
&
C
architecture
view
of
a
system
,
it
is
highly
desirable
to
have
a
different
representation
for
different
component
types
,
so
the
different
types
can
be
identified
visually
.
In
a
box-and-line
diagram
,
often
all
components
are
represented
as
rectangular
boxes
.
Such
an
approach
will
require
that
types
of
the
components
are
described
separately
and
the
reader
has
to
read
the
description
to
figure
out
the
types
of
the
components
.
It
is
much
better
to
use
a
different
symbol/notation
for
each
different
component
type
.
Some
of
the
common
symbols
used
for
representing
commonly
found
component
types
are
shown
in
Figure
To
make
sure
that
the
meanings
of
the
different
symbols
are
clear
to
the
reader
,
it
is
desirable
to
have
a
key
of
the
different
symbols
to
describe
what
The
different
components
of
a
system
are
likely
to
interact
while
the
system
is
in
operation
to
provide
the
services
expected
of
the
system
.
After
all
,
components
exist
to
provide
parts
of
the
services
and
features
of
the
system
,
and
these
must
be
combined
to
deliver
the
overall
system
functionality
.
For
composing
a
system
from
its
components
,
information
about
the
interaction
between
components
is
necessary
.
Interaction
between
components
may
be
through
a
simple
means
supported
by
the
underlying
process
execution
infrastructure
of
the
operating
system
.
For
example
,
a
component
may
interact
with
another
using
the
procedure
call
mechanism
(
a
connector
)
,
which
is
provided
by
the
runtime
environment
for
the
programming
language
.
However
,
the
interaction
may
involve
more
complex
mechanisms
as
well
.
Examples
of
such
mechanisms
are
remote
procedure
call
,
TCP/IP
ports
,
and
a
protocol
like
HTTP
.
These
mechanisms
require
a
fair
amount
of
underlying
runtime
infrastructure
,
as
well
as
special
programming
within
the
components
to
use
the
infrastructure
.
Consequently
,
it
is
extremely
important
to
identify
and
explicitly
represent
these
connectors
.
Specification
of
connectors
will
help
identify
the
suitable
infrastructure
needed
to
implement
an
architecture
,
as
well
as
clarify
the
programming
needs
for
components
using
them
.
Note
that
connectors
need
not
be
binary
and
a
connector
may
provide
an
n-way
communication
between
multiple
components
.
For
example
,
a
broadcast
bus
may
be
used
as
a
connector
,
which
allows
a
component
to
broadcast
its
message
to
all
the
other
components
.
Some
of
the
common
symbols
used
for
representing
commonly
found
connector
types
are
shown
in
Figure
A
connector
also
has
a
name
that
should
describe
the
nature
of
interaction
the
connector
supports
.
A
connector
also
has
a
type
,
which
is
a
generic
de-
scription
of
the
interaction
,
specifying
properties
like
whether
it
is
a
binary
or
n-way
,
types
of
interfaces
it
supports
,
etc
.
If
a
protocol
is
used
by
a
connector
type
,
it
should
be
explicitly
stated
.
It
is
worth
pointing
out
that
the
implementation
of
a
connector
may
be
quite
complex
.
If
the
connector
is
provided
by
the
underlying
system
,
then
the
components
just
have
to
ensure
that
they
use
the
connectors
as
per
their
specifications
.
If
,
however
,
the
underlying
system
does
not
provide
a
connector
used
in
an
architecture
,
then
as
mentioned
above
,
the
connector
will
have
to
be
implemented
as
part
of
the
project
to
build
the
system
.
That
is
,
during
the
development
,
not
only
will
the
components
need
to
be
developed
,
but
resources
will
have
to
be
assigned
to
also
develop
the
connector
.
(
This
situation
might
arise
for
a
specialized
system
that
requires
connectors
that
are
specific
to
the
problem
domain
.
)
Generally
,
while
creating
an
architecture
,
it
is
wise
for
the
architect
to
use
the
connectors
which
are
available
on
the
systems
on
which
the
software
will
be
deployed
.
Suppose
we
have
to
design
and
build
a
simple
system
for
taking
an
on-line
survey
of
students
on
a
campus
.
There
is
a
set
of
multiple-choice
questions
,
and
the
proposed
system
will
provide
the
survey
form
to
the
student
,
who
can
fill
and
submit
it
on-line
.
We
also
want
that
when
the
user
submits
the
form
,
he/she
is
also
shown
the
current
result
of
the
survey
,
that
is
,
what
percentage
of
students
so
far
have
filled
which
options
for
the
different
questions
.
The
system
is
best
built
using
the
Web
;
this
is
the
likely
choice
of
any
developer
.
For
this
simple
system
,
a
traditional
3-tier
architecture
is
proposed
.
It
consists
of
a
client
which
will
display
the
form
that
the
student
can
complete
and
submit
,
and
will
also
display
the
results
.
The
second
component
is
the
server
,
which
processes
the
data
submitted
by
the
student
,
and
saves
it
on
the
database
,
which
is
the
third
component
.
The
server
also
queries
the
database
to
get
the
outcome
of
the
survey
and
sends
the
results
in
proper
format
(
HTML
)
back
to
the
client
,
which
then
displays
the
result
.
The
C
&
C
view
is
shown
in
Figure
Note
that
the
client
,
server
,
and
database
are
all
different
types
of
compo-
nents
,
and
hence
are
shown
using
different
symbols
.
Note
also
that
the
connec-
tors
between
the
components
are
also
of
different
types
.
The
diagram
makes
the
different
types
clear
,
making
the
diagram
stand
alone
and
easy
to
comprehend
.
Note
that
at
the
architecture
level
,
a
host
of
details
are
not
discussed
.
How
is
the
URL
of
the
survey
set
?
What
are
the
modules
that
go
into
building
these
components
and
what
language
are
they
written
in
?
Questions
like
these
are
not
the
issues
at
this
level
.
Note
also
that
the
connector
between
the
client
and
the
server
explicitly
says
that
http
is
to
be
used
.
And
the
diagram
also
says
that
it
is
a
Web
client
.
This
implies
that
it
is
assumed
that
there
will
be
a
Web
browser
running
on
the
machines
from
which
the
student
will
take
the
survey
.
Having
the
http
as
the
connector
also
implies
that
there
is
a
proper
http
server
running
,
and
that
the
server
of
this
system
will
be
suitably
attached
to
it
to
allow
access
by
clients
.
In
other
words
,
the
entire
infrastructure
of
browser
and
the
http
server
,
for
the
purposes
of
this
application
,
mainly
provides
the
connector
between
the
client
and
the
server
(
and
a
virtual
machine
to
run
the
client
of
the
application
)
.
There
are
some
implications
of
choice
of
this
connector
on
the
components
.
The
client
will
have
to
be
written
in
a
manner
that
it
can
send
the
request
using
http
(
this
will
imply
using
some
type
of
scripting
language
or
HTML
forms
)
.
Similarly
,
it
also
implies
that
the
server
has
to
take
its
request
from
the
http
server
in
the
format
specified
by
the
http
protocol
.
Furthermore
,
the
server
has
to
send
its
results
back
to
the
client
in
the
HTML
format
.
These
are
all
constraints
on
implementing
this
architecture
.
Hence
,
when
discussing
it
and
finally
accepting
it
,
the
implications
for
the
infrastructure
as
well
as
the
implementation
should
be
fully
understood
and
actions
should
be
taken
to
make
sure
that
these
assumptions
are
valid
.
The
above
architecture
has
no
security
and
a
student
can
take
the
survey
as
many
times
as
he
wishes
.
Furthermore
,
even
a
nonstudent
can
take
the
survey
.
Now
suppose
the
Dean
of
Students
wants
that
this
system
be
open
only
to
registered
students
,
and
that
each
student
is
allowed
to
take
the
survey
at
most
once
.
To
identify
the
students
,
it
was
explained
that
each
student
has
an
account
,
and
their
account
information
is
available
from
the
main
proxy
server
of
the
institute
.
Now
the
architecture
will
have
to
be
quite
different
.
The
proposed
architec-
ture
now
has
a
separate
login
form
for
the
user
,
and
a
separate
server
component
which
does
the
validation
.
For
validation
,
it
goes
to
the
proxy
for
checking
if
the
login
and
password
provided
are
valid
.
If
so
,
the
server
returns
a
cookie
to
the
client
(
which
stores
it
as
per
the
cookie
protocol
)
.
When
the
student
completes
the
survey
form
,
the
cookie
information
validates
the
user
,
and
the
server
checks
if
this
student
has
already
completed
the
survey
.
The
architecture
for
this
system
is
shown
in
Figure
Note
that
even
though
we
are
saying
that
the
connection
between
the
client
and
the
server
is
that
of
http
,
it
is
somewhat
different
from
the
connection
in
the
earlier
architecture
.
In
the
first
architecture
,
plain
http
is
sufficient
.
In
this
one
,
as
cookies
are
also
needed
,
the
connector
is
really
http
+
cookies
.
So
,
if
the
user
disables
cookies
,
the
required
connector
is
not
available
and
this
architecture
will
not
work
.
Now
suppose
we
want
the
system
to
be
extended
in
a
different
way
.
It
was
found
that
the
database
server
is
somewhat
unreliable
,
and
is
frequently
down
.
It
was
also
felt
that
when
the
student
is
given
the
result
of
the
survey
when
he
submits
the
form
,
a
somewhat
outdated
result
is
acceptable
,
as
the
results
are
really
statistical
data
and
a
little
inaccuracy
will
not
matter
.
We
assume
that
the
survey
result
can
be
outdated
by
about
(
even
if
it
does
not
include
data
of
,
it
is
OK
)
.
What
the
Dean
wanted
was
to
make
the
system
more
reliable
,
and
provide
some
facility
for
completing
the
survey
even
when
the
database
is
down
.
To
make
the
system
more
reliable
,
the
following
strategy
was
proposed
.
When
the
student
submits
the
survey
,
the
server
interacts
with
the
database
as
before
.
The
results
of
the
survey
,
however
,
are
also
stored
in
the
cache
by
the
server
.
If
the
database
is
down
or
unavailable
,
the
survey
data
is
stored
locally
in
a
cache
component
,
and
the
result
saved
in
the
cache
component
is
used
to
provide
the
result
to
the
student
.
(
This
can
be
done
for
up
to
,
after
which
the
survey
can
not
be
completed
.
)
So
,
now
we
have
another
component
in
the
server
called
the
cache
manager
.
And
there
is
a
connection
between
the
server
and
this
new
component
of
the
call/return
type
.
This
architecture
is
shown
in
Figure
It
should
be
clear
that
by
using
the
cache
,
the
availability
of
the
system
is
improved
.
The
cache
will
also
have
an
impact
on
performance
.
These
exten-
sions
show
how
architecture
affects
both
availability
and
performance
,
and
how
properly
selecting
or
tuning
the
architecture
can
help
meet
the
quality
goals
(
or
just
improve
the
quality
of
the
system
)
.
(
Of
course
,
detail-level
decisions
like
how
a
particular
module
is
implemented
also
have
implications
on
performance
,
but
they
are
quite
distinct
and
orthogonal
to
the
architecture-level
decisions
.
)
We
will
later
do
a
formal
evaluation
of
these
different
architectures
to
see
the
impact
of
architectural
decisions
on
some
quality
attributes
.
It
should
be
clear
that
different
systems
will
have
different
architecture
.
There
are
some
general
architectures
that
have
been
observed
in
many
systems
and
that
seem
to
represent
general
structures
that
are
useful
for
architecture
of
a
class
of
problems
.
These
are
called
architectural
styles
.
A
style
defines
a
family
of
architectures
that
satisfy
the
constraints
of
that
style
[
6
,
23
,
76
]
.
In
this
section
we
discuss
some
common
styles
for
the
C
&
C
view
which
can
be
useful
for
a
large
set
of
problems
[
23
,
76
]
.
These
styles
can
provide
ideas
for
creating
an
architecture
view
for
the
problem
at
hand
.
Styles
can
also
be
combined
to
form
richer
views
.
Pipe-and-filter
style
of
architecture
is
well
suited
for
systems
that
primarily
do
data
transformation
whereby
some
input
data
is
received
and
the
goal
of
the
system
is
to
produce
some
output
data
by
suitably
transforming
the
input
data
.
A
system
using
pipe-and-filter
architecture
achieves
the
desired
transformation
by
applying
a
network
of
smaller
transformations
and
composing
them
in
a
manner
such
that
together
the
overall
desired
transformation
is
achieved
.
The
pipe-and-filter
style
has
only
one
component
type
called
the
filter
.
It
also
has
only
one
connector
type
,
called
the
pipe
.
A
filter
performs
a
data
transformation
,
and
sends
the
transformed
data
to
other
filters
for
further
processing
using
the
pipe
connector
.
In
other
words
,
a
filter
receives
the
data
it
needs
from
some
defined
input
pipes
,
performs
the
data
transformation
,
and
then
sends
the
output
data
to
other
filters
on
the
defined
output
pipes
.
A
filter
may
have
more
than
one
input
and
more
than
one
output
.
Filters
can
be
independent
and
asynchronous
entities
,
and
as
they
are
concerned
only
with
the
data
arriving
on
the
pipe
,
a
filter
need
not
know
the
identity
of
the
filter
that
sent
the
input
data
or
the
identity
of
the
filter
that
will
consume
the
data
they
produce
.
The
pipe
connector
is
a
unidirectional
channel
which
conveys
streams
of
data
received
on
one
end
to
the
other
end
.
A
pipe
does
not
change
the
data
in
any
manner
but
merely
transports
it
to
the
filter
on
the
receiver
end
in
the
order
in
which
the
data
elements
are
received
.
As
filters
can
be
asynchronous
and
should
work
without
the
knowledge
of
the
identity
of
the
producer
or
the
consumer
,
buffering
and
synchronization
needs
to
ensure
smooth
functioning
of
the
producer-consumer
relationship
embodied
in
connecting
two
filters
by
a
pipe
is
ensured
by
the
pipe
.
The
filters
merely
consume
and
produce
data
.
There
are
some
constraints
that
this
style
imposes
.
First
,
as
mentioned
above
,
the
filters
should
work
without
knowing
the
identity
of
the
consumer
or
the
producer
;
they
should
only
require
the
data
elements
they
need
.
Second
,
a
pipe
,
which
is
a
two-way
connector
,
must
connect
an
output
port
of
a
filter
to
an
input
port
of
another
filter
.
A
pure
pipe-and-filter
structure
will
also
generally
have
a
constraint
that
a
filter
has
independent
thread
of
control
which
processes
the
data
as
it
comes
.
Implementing
this
will
require
suitable
underlying
infrastructure
to
support
a
pipe
mechanism
which
buffers
the
data
and
does
the
synchronization
needed
(
for
example
,
blocking
the
producer
when
the
buffer
is
full
and
blocking
the
consumer
filter
when
the
buffer
is
empty
)
.
For
using
this
pipe
,
the
filter
builder
must
be
fully
aware
of
the
properties
of
the
pipe
,
particularly
with
regard
to
buffering
and
synchronization
,
input
and
output
mechanisms
,
and
the
symbols
for
end
of
data
.
However
,
there
could
be
situations
in
which
the
constraint
that
a
filter
process
the
data
as
it
comes
may
not
be
required
.
Without
this
constraint
,
pipe-and-filter
style
view
may
have
filters
that
produce
the
data
completely
before
passing
it
on
,
or
which
start
their
processing
only
after
complete
input
is
available
.
In
such
a
system
the
filters
can
not
operate
concurrently
,
and
the
system
is
like
a
batch-processing
system
.
However
,
it
can
considerably
simplify
the
pipes
and
easier
mechanisms
can
be
used
for
supporting
them
.
Let
’
s
consider
an
example
of
a
system
needed
to
count
the
frequency
of
different
words
in
a
file
.
An
architecture
using
the
pipes-and-filter
style
for
a
system
to
achieve
this
is
given
in
Figure
This
architecture
proposes
that
the
input
data
be
first
split
into
a
sequence
of
words
by
a
component
Sequencer
.
This
sequence
of
words
is
then
sorted
by
the
component
Sorting
,
which
passes
the
output
of
sorted
words
to
another
filter
(
Counting
)
that
counts
the
number
of
occurrences
of
the
different
words
.
This
structure
of
sorting
the
words
first
has
been
chosen
as
it
will
make
the
task
of
determining
the
frequency
more
efficient
,
even
though
it
involves
a
sort
operation
.
It
should
be
clear
that
this
proposed
architecture
can
implement
the
desired
functionality
.
Later
in
the
chapter
we
will
further
discuss
some
implementation
issues
related
to
this
architecture
.
As
can
be
seen
from
this
example
,
pipe-and-filter
architectural
style
is
well
suited
for
data
processing
and
transformation
.
Consequently
,
it
is
useful
in
text
processing
applications
.
Signal
processing
applications
also
find
it
useful
as
such
applications
typically
perform
encoding
,
error
correction
,
and
other
transformations
on
the
data
.
The
pipe-and-filter
style
,
due
to
the
constraints
,
allows
a
system
’
s
overall
transformation
to
be
composed
of
smaller
transformations
.
Or
viewing
it
in
another
manner
,
it
allows
a
desired
transformation
to
be
factored
into
smaller
transformations
,
and
then
filters
built
for
the
smaller
transformations
.
That
is
,
it
allows
the
techniques
of
functional
composition
and
decomposition
to
be
utilized
,
something
that
is
mathematically
appealing
.
In
this
style
,
there
are
two
types
of
components—data
repositories
and
data
accessors
.
Components
of
data
repository
type
are
where
the
system
stores
shared
data—these
could
be
file
systems
or
databases
.
These
components
pro-
vide
a
reliable
and
permanent
storage
,
take
care
of
any
synchronization
needs
for
concurrent
access
,
and
provide
data
access
support
.
Components
of
data
accessors
type
access
data
from
the
repositories
,
perform
computation
on
the
data
obtained
,
and
if
they
want
to
share
the
results
with
other
components
,
put
the
results
back
in
the
depository
.
In
other
words
,
the
accessors
are
computa-
tional
elements
that
receive
their
data
from
the
repository
and
save
their
data
in
the
repository
as
well
.
These
components
do
not
directly
communicate
with
each
other—the
data
repository
components
are
the
means
of
communication
and
data
transfer
between
them
.
There
are
two
variations
of
this
style
possible
.
In
the
blackboard
style
,
if
some
data
is
posted
on
the
data
repository
,
all
the
accessor
components
that
need
to
know
about
it
are
informed
.
In
other
words
,
the
shared
data
source
is
an
active
agent
as
well
which
either
informs
the
components
about
the
arrival
of
interesting
data
,
or
starts
the
execution
of
the
components
that
need
to
act
upon
this
new
data
.
In
databases
,
this
form
of
style
is
often
supported
through
triggers
.
The
other
is
the
repository
style
,
in
which
the
data
repository
is
just
a
passive
repository
which
provides
permanent
storage
and
related
controls
for
data
accessing
.
The
components
access
the
repository
as
and
when
they
want
.
As
can
be
imagined
,
many
database
applications
use
this
architectural
style
.
Databases
,
though
originally
more
like
repositories
,
now
act
both
as
repositories
as
well
as
blackboards
as
they
provide
triggers
and
can
act
as
efficient
data
storage
as
well
.
Many
Web
systems
frequently
follow
this
style
at
the
back
end—in
response
to
user
requests
,
different
scripts
(
data
accessors
)
access
and
update
some
shared
data
.
Many
programming
environments
are
also
organized
this
way
:
the
common
representation
of
the
program
artifacts
is
stored
in
the
repository
and
the
different
tools
access
it
to
perform
the
desired
translations
or
to
obtain
the
desired
information
.
(
Some
years
back
there
was
a
standard
defined
for
the
common
repository
to
facilitate
integration
of
tools
.
)
As
an
example
of
a
system
using
this
style
of
architecture
,
let
us
consider
a
student
registration
system
in
a
university
.
The
system
clearly
has
a
central
repository
which
contains
information
about
courses
,
students
,
prerequisites
,
etc
.
It
has
an
Administrator
component
that
sets
up
the
repository
,
rights
to
different
people
,
etc
.
The
Registration
component
allows
students
to
reg-
ister
and
update
the
information
for
students
and
courses
.
The
Approvals
component
is
for
granting
approvals
for
those
courses
that
require
instructor
’
s
consent
.
The
Reports
component
produces
the
report
regarding
the
students
registered
in
different
courses
at
the
end
of
the
registration
.
The
component
Course
Feedback
is
used
for
taking
feedback
from
students
at
the
end
of
the
course
.
This
architecture
is
shown
in
Figure
.
Note
that
the
different
computation
components
do
not
need
to
communi-
cate
with
each
other
and
do
not
even
need
to
know
about
each
other
’
s
presence
.
For
example
,
if
later
it
is
decided
that
the
scheduling
of
courses
can
be
auto-
mated
based
on
data
on
registration
(
and
other
information
about
classrooms
etc
.
)
,
then
another
component
called
Scheduling
can
be
simply
added
.
No
ex-
isting
computation
component
needs
to
change
or
be
informed
about
the
new
component
being
added
.
(
This
example
is
based
on
a
system
that
is
actually
used
in
the
author
’
s
university
.
)
There
is
really
only
one
connector
type
in
this
style—read/write
.
Note
,
how-
ever
,
that
this
general
connector
style
may
take
more
precise
form
in
particular
architectures
.
For
example
,
though
a
database
can
be
viewed
as
supporting
read
and
updates
,
for
a
program
interacting
with
it
,
the
database
system
may
provide
transaction
services
as
well
.
Connectors
using
this
transaction
service
allow
complete
transactions
(
which
may
involve
multiple
reads
and
writes
and
preserve
atomicity
)
to
be
performed
by
an
application
.
Note
also
that
as
in
many
other
cases
,
the
connectors
involve
a
consider-
able
amount
of
underlying
infrastructure
.
For
example
,
read
and
writes
to
a
file
system
involve
a
fair
amount
of
file
system
software
involving
issues
like
directories
,
buffering
,
locking
,
and
synchronization
.
Similarly
,
a
considerable
amount
of
software
goes
into
databases
to
support
the
type
of
connections
it
provides
for
query
,
update
,
and
transactions
.
We
will
see
another
use
of
this
style
later
when
we
discuss
the
case
studies
.
Another
very
common
style
used
to
build
systems
today
is
the
client-server
style
.
Client-server
computing
is
one
of
the
basic
paradigms
of
distributed
com-
puting
and
this
architecture
style
is
built
upon
this
paradigm
.
In
this
style
,
there
are
two
component
types—clients
and
servers
.
A
con-
straint
of
this
style
is
that
a
client
can
only
communicate
with
the
server
,
and
can
not
communicate
with
other
clients
.
The
communication
between
a
client
component
and
a
server
component
is
initiated
by
the
client
when
the
client
sends
a
request
for
some
service
that
the
server
supports
.
The
server
receives
the
request
at
its
defined
port
,
performs
the
service
,
and
then
returns
the
results
of
the
computation
to
the
client
who
requested
the
service
.
There
is
one
connector
type
in
this
style—the
request/reply
type
.
A
con-
nector
connects
a
client
to
a
server
.
This
type
of
connector
is
asymmetric—the
client
end
of
the
connector
can
only
make
requests
(
and
receive
the
reply
)
,
while
the
server
end
can
only
send
replies
in
response
to
the
requests
it
gets
through
this
connector
.
The
communication
is
frequently
synchronous—the
client
waits
for
the
server
to
return
the
results
before
proceeding
.
That
is
,
the
client
is
blocked
at
the
request
,
until
it
gets
the
reply
.
A
general
form
of
this
style
is
an
n-tier
structure
.
In
this
style
,
a
client
sends
a
request
to
a
server
,
but
the
server
,
in
order
to
service
the
request
,
sends
some
request
to
another
server
.
That
is
,
the
server
also
acts
as
a
client
for
the
next
tier
.
This
hierarchy
can
continue
for
some
levels
,
providing
an
n-tier
system
.
A
common
example
of
this
is
the
3-tier
architecture
.
In
this
style
,
the
clients
that
make
requests
and
receive
the
final
results
reside
in
the
client
tier
.
The
middle
tier
,
called
the
business
tier
,
contains
the
component
that
processes
the
data
submitted
by
the
clients
and
applies
the
necessary
business
rules
.
The
third
tier
is
the
database
tier
in
which
the
data
resides
.
The
business
tier
interacts
with
the
database
tier
for
all
its
data
needs
.
Most
often
,
in
a
client-server
architecture
,
the
client
and
the
server
com-
ponent
reside
on
different
machines
.
Even
if
they
reside
on
the
same
machine
,
they
are
designed
in
a
manner
such
that
they
can
exist
on
different
machines
.
Hence
,
the
connector
between
the
client
and
the
server
is
expected
to
support
the
request/result
type
of
connection
across
different
machines
.
Consequently
,
these
connectors
are
internally
quite
complex
and
involve
a
fair
amount
of
net-
working
to
support
.
Many
of
the
client-server
systems
today
use
TCP
ports
for
their
connectors
.
The
Web
uses
the
HTTP
for
supporting
this
connector
.
Note
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
layered
architecture
and
a
tiered
architecture
.
The
tiered
style
is
a
component
and
connector
architecture
view
in
which
each
tier
is
a
component
,
and
these
components
communicate
with
the
adjacent
ones
through
a
defined
protocol
.
A
layered
architecture
is
a
module
view
providing
how
modules
are
organized
and
used
.
In
the
layered
organiza-
tion
,
modules
are
organized
in
layers
with
modules
in
a
layer
allowed
to
invoke
services
only
of
the
modules
in
the
layer
below
.
Hence
,
layered
and
tiered
rep-
resent
two
different
views
.
We
can
have
an
n-tiered
architecture
in
which
some
tier
(
s
)
have
a
layered
architecture
.
For
example
,
in
a
client-server
architecture
,
the
server
might
have
a
layered
architecture
,
that
is
,
modules
that
compose
the
server
are
organized
in
the
layered
style
.
Publish-Subscribe
Style
In
this
style
,
there
are
two
types
of
components
.
One
type
of
component
subscribes
to
a
set
of
defined
events
.
Other
types
of
compo-
nents
generate
or
publish
events
.
In
response
to
these
events
,
the
components
that
have
published
their
intent
to
process
the
event
,
are
invoked
.
This
type
of
style
is
most
natural
in
user
interface
frameworks
,
where
many
events
are
defined
(
like
mouse
click
)
and
components
are
assigned
to
these
events
.
When
that
event
occurs
,
the
associated
component
is
executed
.
As
is
the
case
with
most
connectors
,
it
is
the
task
of
the
runtime
infrastructure
to
ensure
that
this
type
of
connector
(
i.e.
,
publish-subscribe
)
is
supported
.
This
style
can
be
seen
as
a
special
case
of
the
blackboard
style
,
except
that
the
repository
aspect
is
not
being
used
.
Peer-to-peer
style
,
or
object-oriented
style
If
we
take
a
client-server
style
,
and
generalize
each
component
to
be
a
client
as
well
as
a
server
,
then
we
have
this
style
.
In
this
style
,
components
are
peers
and
any
component
can
request
a
service
from
any
other
component
.
The
object-oriented
computation
model
represents
this
style
well
.
If
we
view
components
as
objects
,
and
connectors
as
method
invocations
,
then
we
have
this
style
.
This
model
is
the
one
that
is
primarily
supported
through
middleware
connectors
like
CORBA
or
.NET
.
Communicating
processes
style
Perhaps
the
oldest
model
of
distributed
com-
puting
is
that
of
communicating
processes
.
This
style
tries
to
capture
this
model
of
computing
.
The
components
in
this
model
are
processes
or
threads
,
which
communicate
with
each
other
either
with
message
passing
or
through
shared
memory
.
This
style
is
used
in
some
form
in
many
complex
systems
which
use
multiple
threads
or
processes
.
So
far
we
have
focused
on
representing
views
through
diagrams
.
While
de-
signing
,
diagrams
are
indeed
a
good
way
to
explore
options
and
encourage
discussion
and
brainstorming
between
the
architects
.
But
when
the
designing
is
over
,
the
architecture
has
to
be
properly
communicated
to
all
stakehold-
ers
for
negotiation
and
agreement
.
This
requires
that
architecture
be
precisely
documented
with
enough
information
to
perform
the
types
of
analysis
the
dif-
ferent
stakeholders
wish
to
make
to
satisfy
themselves
that
their
concerns
have
been
adequately
addressed
.
Without
a
properly
documented
description
of
the
architecture
,
it
is
not
possible
to
have
a
clear
common
understanding
.
Hence
,
properly
documenting
an
architecture
is
as
important
as
creating
one
.
In
this
section
,
we
discuss
what
an
architecture
document
should
contain
.
Our
discus-
sion
is
based
on
the
recommendations
in
[
6
,
23
,
54
]
.
Just
like
different
projects
require
different
views
,
different
projects
will
need
different
level
of
detail
in
their
architecture
documentation
.
In
general
,
however
,
a
document
describing
the
architecture
should
contain
the
following
:
We
know
that
an
architecture
for
a
system
is
driven
by
the
system
objectives
and
the
needs
of
the
stakeholders
.
Hence
,
the
first
aspect
that
an
architecture
document
should
contain
is
identification
of
stakeholders
and
their
concerns
.
This
portion
should
give
an
overview
of
the
system
,
the
different
stakeholders
,
and
the
system
properties
for
which
the
architecture
will
be
evaluated
.
A
con-
text
diagram
that
establishes
the
scope
of
the
system
,
its
boundaries
,
the
key
actors
that
interact
with
the
system
,
and
sources
and
sinks
of
data
can
also
be
very
useful
.
A
context
diagram
is
frequently
represented
by
showing
the
system
in
the
center
,
and
showing
its
connections
with
people
and
systems
,
including
sources
and
sinks
of
data
.
With
the
context
defined
,
the
document
can
proceed
with
describing
the
different
structures
or
views
.
As
stated
before
,
multiple
views
of
different
types
may
be
needed
,
and
which
views
are
chosen
depends
on
the
needs
of
the
project
and
its
stakeholders
.
The
description
of
views
in
the
architecture
documentation
will
almost
always
contain
a
pictorial
representation
of
the
view
,
which
is
often
the
primary
presentation
of
the
view
.
As
discussed
earlier
,
in
any
view
diagram
it
is
desirable
to
have
different
symbols
for
different
element
types
and
provide
a
key
for
the
different
types
,
such
that
the
type
of
the
different
components
(
represented
using
the
symbols
)
is
clear
to
a
reader
.
It
is
,
of
course
,
highly
desirable
to
keep
the
diagram
simple
and
uncluttered
.
If
necessary
,
to
keep
the
complexity
of
the
view
manageable
,
a
hierarchical
approach
can
be
followed
to
make
the
main
view
simple
(
and
provide
further
details
as
structure
of
the
elements
)
.
However
,
a
pictorial
representation
is
not
a
complete
description
of
the
view
.
It
gives
an
intuitive
idea
of
the
design
,
but
is
not
sufficient
for
providing
the
details
.
For
example
,
the
purpose
and
functionality
of
a
module
or
a
component
is
indicated
only
by
its
name
which
is
not
sufficient
.
Hence
,
supporting
doc-
umentation
is
needed
for
the
view
diagrams
.
This
supporting
documentation
should
have
some
or
all
of
the
following
:
Element
Catalog
.
Provides
more
information
about
the
elements
shown
in
the
primary
representation
.
Besides
describing
the
purpose
of
the
element
,
it
should
also
describe
the
elements
’
interfaces
(
remember
that
all
elements
have
interfaces
through
which
they
interact
with
other
elements
)
.
All
the
different
interfaces
provided
by
the
elements
should
be
specified
.
Interfaces
should
have
unique
identity
,
and
the
specification
should
give
both
syntactic
and
semantic
information
.
Syntactic
information
is
often
in
terms
of
signa-
tures
,
which
describe
all
the
data
items
involved
in
the
interface
and
their
types
.
Semantic
information
must
describe
what
the
interface
does
.
The
de-
scription
should
also
clearly
state
the
error
conditions
that
the
interface
can
return
.
Architecture
Rationale
.
Though
a
view
specifies
the
elements
and
the
rela-
tionship
between
them
,
it
does
not
provide
any
insight
into
why
the
architect
chose
the
particular
structure
.
Architecture
rationale
gives
the
reasons
for
se-
lecting
the
different
elements
and
composing
them
in
the
way
it
was
done
.
This
section
may
also
provide
some
discussion
on
the
alternatives
that
were
considered
and
why
they
were
rejected
.
This
discussion
,
besides
explaining
the
choices
,
is
also
useful
later
when
an
analyst
making
a
change
wonders
why
the
architecture
should
not
be
changed
in
some
manner
(
that
might
make
the
change
easy
)
.
Behavior
.
A
view
gives
the
structural
information
.
It
does
not
represent
the
actual
behavior
or
execution
.
Consequently
,
in
a
structure
,
all
possible
in-
teractions
during
an
execution
are
shown
.
Sometimes
,
it
is
necessary
to
get
some
idea
of
the
actual
behavior
of
the
system
in
some
scenarios
.
Such
a
description
is
useful
for
arguing
about
properties
like
deadlock
.
Behavior
de-
scription
can
be
provided
to
help
aid
understanding
of
the
system
execution
.
Often
diagrams
like
collaboration
diagrams
or
sequence
diagrams
(
we
will
discuss
these
further
in
Chapter
)
are
used
.
Other
Information
.
This
may
include
a
description
of
all
those
decisions
that
have
not
been
taken
during
architecture
creation
but
have
been
deliberately
left
for
the
future
,
such
as
,
the
choice
of
a
server
or
protocol
.
If
this
is
done
,
then
it
must
be
specified
as
fixing
these
will
have
impact
on
the
architecture
.
We
know
that
the
different
views
are
related
.
In
what
we
have
discussed
so
far
,
the
views
have
been
described
independently
.
The
architecture
document
,
therefore
,
besides
describing
the
views
,
should
also
describe
the
relationship
between
the
different
views
.
This
is
the
primary
purpose
of
the
across
view
documentation
.
Essentially
,
this
documentation
describes
the
relationship
be-
tween
elements
of
the
different
views
(
for
example
,
how
modules
in
a
module
view
relate
to
components
in
a
component
view
,
or
how
components
in
a
C
&
C
view
relate
to
processes
in
a
process
view
)
.
This
part
of
the
document
can
also
describe
the
rationale
of
the
overall
architecture
,
why
the
selected
views
were
chosen
,
and
any
other
information
that
cuts
across
views
.
However
,
often
the
relationship
between
the
different
views
is
straightfor-
ward
or
very
strong
.
In
such
situations
,
the
different
structures
may
look
very
similar
and
describing
the
views
separately
can
lead
to
a
repetition
.
In
such
situations
,
for
practical
reasons
,
it
is
better
to
combine
different
views
into
one
.
Besides
eliminating
the
duplication
,
this
approach
can
also
help
clearly
show
the
strong
relationship
between
the
two
views
(
and
in
the
process
also
reduce
the
across
view
documentation
)
.
Combined
views
are
also
useful
for
some
analysis
which
requires
multiple
views
,
for
example
,
performance
analy-
sis
,
which
frequently
requires
both
the
C
&
C
view
as
well
as
the
allocation
view
.
So
,
sometimes
,
it
may
be
desirable
to
show
some
combined
views
.
Combining
of
views
,
however
,
should
be
done
only
if
the
relationship
be-
tween
the
views
is
strong
and
straightforward
.
Otherwise
,
putting
multiple
views
in
one
diagram
will
clutter
the
view
and
make
it
confusing
.
The
objec-
tive
of
reveal
multiple
views
in
one
is
not
merely
to
reduce
the
number
of
views
,
but
is
to
be
done
primarily
to
aid
understanding
and
showing
the
relationships
.
An
example
of
combining
is
when
there
are
multiple
modules
in
the
module
view
that
form
the
different
layers
in
the
layer
view
.
In
such
a
situation
,
it
is
probably
more
natural
to
show
one
view
consisting
of
the
layers
,
and
overlay-
ing
the
module
structure
on
the
layers
,
that
is
,
showing
the
module
structure
within
the
layers
.
Many
layered
systems
’
architectures
actually
use
this
ap-
proach
.
In
such
a
situation
,
it
is
best
to
show
them
together
,
creating
a
hybrid
style
in
which
both
a
module
view
and
a
C
&
C
view
are
captured
.
Overall
,
if
the
mapping
can
be
shown
easily
and
in
a
simple
manner
,
then
different
views
should
be
combined
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
and
compactness
.
If
,
however
,
the
relationship
between
the
different
views
is
complex
(
for
example
,
a
many-
to-many
relationship
between
elements
of
the
different
views
)
,
then
it
is
best
to
keep
them
separate
and
specify
the
relationship
separately
.
The
general
structure
discussed
here
can
provide
a
guide
for
organizing
the
architecture
document
.
However
,
the
main
purpose
of
the
document
is
to
clearly
communicate
the
architecture
to
the
stakeholders
such
that
the
desired
analysis
can
be
done
.
And
if
some
of
these
sections
are
redundant
for
that
purpose
,
they
may
not
be
included
.
Similarly
,
if
more
information
needs
to
be
provided
,
then
it
should
be
done
.
Finally
,
a
word
on
the
language
chosen
for
describing
different
parts
of
the
architecture
.
Here
the
choice
varies
from
the
formal
architecture
description
languages
(
ADLs
)
to
informal
notation
.
Many
people
now
use
UML
to
repre-
sent
the
architecture
,
which
allows
various
possibilities
to
show
the
primary
description
of
the
view
and
also
allows
annotation
capability
for
supporting
document
.
We
believe
that
any
method
can
be
used
,
as
long
as
the
objective
is
met
.
To
allow
flexibility
,
we
suggest
using
a
problem-specific
notation
,
but
following
the
guidelines
for
good
view
representation
,
and
using
a
combination
of
header
definitions
and
text
for
the
supporting
documentation
.
Architecture
of
a
software
system
impacts
some
of
the
key
nonfunctional
qual-
ity
attributes
like
modifiability
,
performance
,
reliability
,
portability
,
etc
.
The
architecture
has
a
much
more
significant
impact
on
some
of
these
properties
than
the
design
and
coding
choices
.
That
is
,
even
though
choices
of
algorithms
,
data
structures
,
etc.
,
are
important
for
many
of
these
attributes
,
often
they
have
less
of
an
impact
than
the
architectural
choices
.
Clearly
then
,
evaluating
a
proposed
architecture
for
these
properties
can
have
a
beneficial
impact
on
the
project—any
architectural
changes
that
are
required
to
meet
the
desired
goals
for
these
attributes
can
be
done
during
the
architecture
design
itself
.
There
are
many
nonfunctional
quality
attributes
.
Not
all
of
them
are
af-
fected
by
architecture
significantly
.
Some
of
the
attributes
on
which
architecture
has
a
significant
impact
are
performance
,
reliability
and
availability
,
security
(
some
aspects
of
it
)
,
modifiability
,
reusability
,
and
portability
.
Attributes
like
usability
are
only
mildly
affected
by
architecture
.
How
should
a
proposed
architecture
be
evaluated
for
these
attributes
?
For
some
attributes
like
performance
and
reliability
,
it
is
possible
to
build
formal
models
using
techniques
like
queuing
networks
and
use
them
for
assessing
the
value
of
the
attribute
.
However
,
these
models
require
information
beyond
the
architecture
description
,
generally
in
forms
of
execution
times
,
and
reliability
of
each
component
.
Another
approach
is
procedural—a
sequence
of
steps
is
followed
to
subjec-
tively
evaluate
the
impact
of
the
architecture
on
some
of
the
attributes
.
One
such
informal
analysis
approach
that
is
often
used
is
as
follows
.
First
identify
the
attributes
of
interest
for
which
an
architecture
should
be
evaluated
.
These
attributes
are
usually
determined
from
stakeholders
’
interests—the
attributes
the
different
stakeholders
are
most
interested
in
.
These
attributes
are
then
listed
in
a
table
.
Then
for
each
attribute
,
an
experience-based
,
subjective
(
or
quantitative
)
analysis
is
done
,
to
assess
the
level
supported
by
the
architecture
.
The
analysis
might
mention
the
level
for
each
attribute
(
e.g.
,
good
,
average
,
poor
)
,
or
might
simply
mention
whether
it
is
satisfactory
or
not
.
Based
on
the
outcome
of
this
analysis
,
the
architecture
is
either
accepted
or
rejected
.
If
rejected
,
it
may
be
enhanced
to
improve
the
performance
for
the
attribute
for
which
the
proposed
architecture
was
unsatisfactory
.
Many
techniques
have
been
proposed
for
evaluation
,
and
a
survey
of
them
is
given
in
[
29
]
.
Architecture
of
a
software
system
provides
a
very
high-level
view
of
the
system
in
terms
of
parts
of
the
system
and
how
they
are
related
to
form
the
whole
system
.
Depending
on
how
the
system
is
partitioned
,
we
get
a
different
architectural
view
of
the
system
.
Consequently
,
the
architecture
of
a
software
system
is
defined
as
the
structures
of
the
system
which
comprise
software
elements
,
their
externally
visible
properties
,
and
relationships
among
them
.
Architecture
facilitates
development
of
a
high-quality
system
.
It
also
allows
analysis
of
many
of
the
system
properties
like
performance
that
depend
mostly
on
architecture
to
be
done
early
in
the
software
life
cycle
.
There
are
three
main
architectural
views
of
a
system—module
,
component
and
connector
,
and
allocation
.
In
a
module
view
,
the
system
is
viewed
as
a
structure
of
programming
modules
like
packages
,
classes
,
functions
,
etc
.
In
a
component
and
connector
(
C
&
C
)
view
,
the
system
is
a
collection
of
runtime
entities
called
components
,
which
interact
with
each
other
through
the
connectors
.
An
allocation
view
describes
how
the
different
software
units
are
allocated
to
hardware
resources
in
the
system
.
C
&
C
view
is
most
common
,
and
is
often
the
centerpiece
of
the
architecture
description
.
This
view
is
often
described
by
block
diagrams
specifying
the
different
components
and
the
different
connectors
between
the
components
.
There
are
some
common
styles
for
a
C
&
C
view
which
have
been
found
useful
for
creating
this
architecture
view
for
a
system
.
These
include
pipe
and
filter
,
shared
data
,
client-server
,
publish-subscribe
,
peer
to
peer
,
and
communicat-
ing
processes
styles
.
Each
of
these
styles
describes
the
types
of
components
and
connectors
that
exist
and
the
constraints
on
how
they
are
used
.
The
pipe
and
filter
has
one
type
of
component
(
filter
)
and
one
type
of
connector
(
pipe
)
and
components
can
be
connected
through
the
pipe
.
The
client-server
style
has
two
types
of
components
(
client
and
server
)
and
there
is
one
connector
(
request/reply
)
.
A
client
can
only
communicate
with
the
server
,
and
an
interaction
is
initiated
by
a
client
.
In
shared
data
style
the
two
component
types
are
repository
and
data
accessors
.
Data
accessors
read/write
the
repository
and
share
information
among
themselves
through
the
repository
.
The
architecture
forms
the
foundation
for
the
system
and
rest
of
the
design
and
development
activities
,
and
needs
to
be
properly
documented
.
A
proper
architecture
document
should
describe
the
context
in
which
the
architecture
was
designed
,
the
different
architectural
views
that
were
created
,
and
how
the
different
views
relate
to
each
other
.
The
architecture
description
should
specify
the
different
types
of
elements
and
their
external
behavior
,
and
the
architecture
rationale
.
Architecture
should
be
evaluated
to
see
that
it
satisfies
the
requirements
.
A
common
approach
is
to
do
a
subjective
evaluation
with
respect
to
the
desired
properties
.
Why
is
architecture
not
just
one
structure
consisting
of
different
parts
and
their
relationship
?
What
are
the
different
architectural
styles
for
the
component
and
connector
struc-
ture
of
a
system
?
Consider
an
interactive
website
which
provides
many
different
features
to
perform
various
tasks
.
Show
that
the
architecture
for
this
can
be
represented
as
a
shared-
data
style
as
well
as
client-server
style
.
Which
one
will
you
prefer
and
why
?
What
should
an
architecture
document
for
a
system
contain
.
Suggest
how
you
will
evaluate
a
proposed
architecture
from
a
modifiability
per-
spective
.
The
design
activity
begins
when
the
requirements
document
for
the
software
to
be
developed
is
available
and
the
architecture
has
been
designed
.
During
design
we
further
refine
the
architecture
.
Generally
,
design
focuses
on
what
we
have
called
the
module
view
in
Chapter
5
.
That
is
,
during
design
we
determine
what
modules
the
system
should
have
and
which
have
to
be
developed
.
Often
,
the
module
view
may
effectively
be
a
module
structure
of
each
component
in
the
architecture
.
In
that
case
,
the
design
exercise
determines
the
module
structure
of
the
components
.
However
,
this
simple
mapping
of
components
and
modules
may
not
always
hold
.
In
that
case
we
have
to
ensure
that
the
module
view
created
in
design
is
consistent
with
the
architecture
.
The
design
of
a
system
is
essentially
a
blueprint
or
a
plan
for
a
solution
for
the
system
.
Here
we
consider
a
system
to
be
a
set
of
modules
with
clearly
defined
behavior
which
interact
with
each
other
in
a
defined
manner
to
produce
some
behavior
or
services
for
its
environment
.
The
design
process
for
software
systems
often
has
two
levels
.
At
the
first
level
the
focus
is
on
deciding
which
modules
are
needed
for
the
system
,
the
specifications
of
these
modules
,
and
how
the
modules
should
be
interconnected
.
This
is
what
may
be
called
the
module
design
or
the
high-level
design
.
In
the
second
level
,
the
internal
design
of
the
modules
,
or
how
the
specifications
of
the
module
can
be
satisfied
,
is
decided
.
This
design
level
is
often
called
detailed
design
or
logic
design
.
Detailed
design
essentially
expands
the
system
design
to
contain
a
more
detailed
description
of
the
processing
logic
and
data
structures
so
that
the
design
is
sufficiently
complete
for
coding
.

Most
design
methodologies
focus
on
the
module
design
,
but
do
not
reduce
the
design
activity
to
a
sequence
of
steps
that
can
be
blindly

Some
metrics
for
quantifying
the
complexity
of
a
design
.
The
design
of
a
system
is
correct
if
a
system
built
precisely
according
to
the
design
satisfies
the
requirements
of
that
system
.
Clearly
,
the
goal
during
the
design
phase
is
to
produce
correct
designs
.
However
,
correctness
is
not
the
sole
criterion
during
the
design
phase
,
as
there
can
be
many
correct
designs
.
The
goal
of
the
design
process
is
not
simply
to
produce
a
design
for
the
system
.
Instead
,
the
goal
is
to
find
the
best
possible
design
within
the
limitations
im-
posed
by
the
requirements
and
the
physical
and
social
environment
in
which
the
system
will
operate
.
To
evaluate
a
design
,
we
have
to
specify
some
evaluation
criteria
.
We
will
focus
on
modularity
of
a
system
,
which
is
decided
mostly
by
design
,
as
the
main
criterion
for
evaluation
.
A
system
is
considered
modular
if
it
consists
of
discrete
modules
so
that
each
module
can
be
implemented
separately
,
and
a
change
to
one
module
has
minimal
impact
on
other
modules
.
Modularity
is
clearly
a
desirable
property
.
Modularity
helps
in
system
debugging—isolating
the
system
problem
to
a
module
is
easier
if
the
system
is
modular
;
in
system
repair—changing
a
part
of
the
system
is
easy
as
it
affects
few
other
parts
;
and
in
system
building—a
modular
system
can
be
easily
built
by
“
putting
its
modules
together
.
”
A
software
system
can
not
be
made
modular
by
simply
chopping
it
into
a
set
of
modules
.
For
modularity
,
each
module
needs
to
support
a
well-defined
abstraction
and
have
a
clear
interface
through
which
it
can
interact
with
other
modules
.
To
produce
modular
designs
,
some
criteria
must
be
used
to
select
modules
so
that
the
modules
support
well-defined
abstractions
and
are
solv-
able
and
modifiable
separately
.
Coupling
and
cohesion
are
two
modularization
criteria
,
which
are
often
used
together
.
We
also
discuss
the
open-closed
princi-
ple
,
which
is
another
criterion
for
modularity
.
Two
modules
are
considered
independent
if
one
can
function
completely
with-
out
the
presence
of
the
other
.
Obviously
,
if
two
modules
are
independent
,
they
are
solvable
and
modifiable
separately
.
However
,
all
the
modules
in
a
system
can
not
be
independent
of
each
other
,
as
they
must
interact
so
that
together
they
produce
the
desired
external
behavior
of
the
system
.
The
more
connections
between
modules
,
the
more
dependent
they
are
in
the
sense
that
more
knowl-
edge
about
one
module
is
required
to
understand
or
solve
the
other
module
.
Hence
,
the
fewer
and
simpler
the
connections
between
modules
,
the
easier
it
is
to
understand
one
without
understanding
the
other
.
The
notion
of
coupling
[
79
,
88
]
attempts
to
capture
this
concept
of
“
how
strongly
”
different
modules
are
interconnected
.
Coupling
between
modules
is
the
strength
of
interconnections
between
mod-
ules
or
a
measure
of
interdependence
among
modules
.
In
general
,
the
more
we
must
know
about
module
A
in
order
to
understand
module
B
,
the
more
closely
connected
A
is
to
B
.
“
Highly
coupled
”
modules
are
joined
by
strong
interconnections
,
while
“
loosely
coupled
”
modules
have
weak
interconnections
.
Independent
modules
have
no
interconnections
.
To
solve
and
modify
a
module
separately
,
we
would
like
the
module
to
be
loosely
coupled
with
other
mod-
ules
.
The
choice
of
modules
decides
the
coupling
between
modules
.
Because
the
modules
of
the
software
system
are
created
during
system
design
,
the
cou-
pling
between
modules
is
largely
decided
during
system
design
and
can
not
be
reduced
during
implementation
.
Coupling
increases
with
the
complexity
and
obscurity
of
the
interface
be-
tween
modules
.
To
keep
coupling
low
we
would
like
to
minimize
the
number
of
interfaces
per
module
and
the
complexity
of
each
interface
.
An
interface
of
a
module
is
used
to
pass
information
to
and
from
other
modules
.
Coupling
is
reduced
if
only
the
defined
entry
interface
of
a
module
is
used
by
other
modules
,
for
example
,
passing
information
to
and
from
a
module
exclusively
through
pa-
rameters
.
Coupling
would
increase
if
a
module
is
used
by
other
modules
via
an
indirect
and
obscure
interface
,
like
directly
using
the
internals
of
a
module
or
using
shared
variables
.
Complexity
of
the
interface
is
another
factor
affecting
coupling
.
The
more
complex
each
interface
is
,
the
higher
will
be
the
degree
of
coupling
.
For
example
,
complexity
of
the
entry
interface
of
a
procedure
depends
on
the
number
of
items
being
passed
as
parameters
and
on
the
complexity
of
the
items
.
Some
level
of
complexity
of
interfaces
is
required
to
support
the
communication
needed
be-
tween
modules
.
However
,
often
more
than
this
minimum
is
used
.
For
example
,
if
a
field
of
a
record
is
needed
by
a
procedure
,
often
the
entire
record
is
passed
,
rather
than
just
passing
that
field
of
the
record
.
By
passing
the
record
we
are
increasing
the
coupling
unnecessarily
.
Essentially
,
we
should
keep
the
interface
of
a
module
as
simple
and
small
as
possible
.
The
type
of
information
flow
along
the
interfaces
is
the
third
major
factor
affecting
coupling
.
There
are
two
kinds
of
information
that
can
flow
along
an
interface
:
data
or
control
.
Passing
or
receiving
control
information
means
that
the
action
of
the
module
will
depend
on
this
control
information
,
which
makes
it
more
difficult
to
understand
the
module
and
provide
its
abstraction
.
Transfer
of
data
information
means
that
a
module
passes
as
input
some
data
to
another
module
and
gets
in
return
some
data
as
output
.
This
allows
a
module
to
be
treated
as
a
simple
input-output
function
that
performs
some
transformation
on
the
input
data
to
produce
the
output
data
.
In
general
,
interfaces
with
only
data
communication
result
in
the
lowest
degree
of
coupling
,
followed
by
interfaces
that
only
transfer
control
data
.
Coupling
is
considered
highest
if
the
data
is
hybrid
,
that
is
,
some
data
items
and
some
control
items
are
passed
between
modules
.
The
effect
of
these
three
factors
on
coupling
is
summarized
in
Table
[
79
]
.

The
manifestation
of
coupling
in
OO
systems
is
somewhat
different
as
objects
are
semantically
richer
than
functions
.
In
OO
systems
,
three
different
types
of
coupling
exist
between
modules
[
30
]
:
Interaction
coupling
occurs
due
to
methods
of
a
class
invoking
methods
of
other
classes
.
In
many
ways
,
this
situation
is
similar
to
a
function
calling
an-
other
function
and
hence
this
coupling
is
similar
to
coupling
between
functional
modules
discussed
above
.
Like
with
functions
,
the
worst
form
of
coupling
here
is
if
methods
directly
access
internal
parts
of
other
methods
.
Coupling
is
lowest
if
methods
communicate
directly
through
parameters
.
Within
this
category
,
as
discussed
above
,
coupling
is
lower
if
only
data
is
passed
,
but
is
higher
if
control
information
is
passed
since
the
invoked
method
impacts
the
execution
sequence
in
the
calling
method
.
Also
,
coupling
is
higher
if
the
amount
of
data
being
passed
is
increased
.
So
,
if
whole
data
structures
are
passed
when
only
some
parts
are
needed
,
coupling
is
being
unnecessarily
increased
.
Similarly
,
if
an
object
is
passed
to
a
method
when
only
some
of
its
component
objects
are
used
within
the
method
,
coupling
increases
unnecessarily
.
The
least
coupling
situation
therefore
is
when
communication
is
with
parameters
only
,
with
only
necessary
variables
being
passed
,
and
these
parameters
only
pass
data
.
Component
coupling
refers
to
the
interaction
between
two
classes
where
a
class
has
variables
of
the
other
class
.
Three
clear
situations
exist
as
to
how
this
can
happen
.
A
class
C
can
be
component
coupled
with
another
class
C1
,
if
C
has
an
instance
variable
of
type
C1
,
or
C
has
a
method
whose
parameter
is
of
type
C1
,
or
if
C
has
a
method
which
has
a
local
variable
of
type
C1
.
Note
that
when
C
is
component
coupled
with
C1
,
it
has
the
potential
of
being
component
coupled
with
all
subclasses
of
C.
It
should
be
clear
that
whenever
there
is
component
coupling
,
there
is
likely
to
be
interaction
coupling
.
Component
coupling
is
considered
to
be
weakest
(
i.e
.
most
desired
)
if
in
a
class
C
,
the
variables
of
class
C
,
or
are
some
attributes
of
C.
If
interaction
is
through
local
variables
,
then
this
interaction
is
not
visible
from
outside
,
and
therefore
increases
coupling
.
Inheritance
coupling
is
due
to
the
inheritance
relationship
between
classes
.
Two
classes
are
considered
inheritance
coupled
if
one
class
is
a
direct
or
indirect
subclass
of
the
other
.
If
inheritance
adds
coupling
,
one
can
ask
the
question
why
not
do
away
with
inheritance
altogether
.
The
reason
is
that
inheritance
may
reduce
the
overall
coupling
in
the
system
.
Let
us
consider
two
situations
.
If
a
class
A
is
coupled
with
another
class
B
,
and
if
B
is
a
hierarchy
with
B
B
,
then
if
a
method
m
(
)
is
factored
out
of
B
,
the
coupling
drops
as
A
is
now
only
coupled
with
B
,
whereas
earlier
it
was
coupled
with
both
B2
.
Similarly
,
if
B
is
a
class
hierarchy
which
supports
specialization-generalization
relationship
,
then
if
new
subclasses
are
added
to
B
,
no
changes
need
to
be
made
to
a
class
A
which
calls
methods
in
B
.
That
is
,
for
changing
B
’
s
hierarchy
,
A
need
not
be
disturbed
.
Without
this
hierarchy
,
changes
in
B
would
most
likely
result
in
changes
in
A
.
Within
inheritance
coupling
there
are
some
situations
that
are
worse
than
others
.
The
worst
form
is
when
a
subclass
B
(
or
deletes
the
method
)
.
This
situation
can
easily
lead
to
a
runtime
error
,
besides
violating
the
true
spirit
of
the
is-a
relationship
.
If
the
signature
is
preserved
but
the
implementation
of
a
method
is
changed
,
that
also
violates
the
is-a
relationship
,
though
may
not
lead
to
a
runtime
error
,
and
should
be
avoided
.
The
least
coupling
scenario
is
when
a
subclass
only
adds
instance
variables
and
methods
but
does
not
modify
any
inherited
ones
.
We
have
seen
that
coupling
is
reduced
when
the
relationships
among
elements
in
different
modules
are
minimized
.
That
is
,
coupling
is
reduced
when
elements
in
different
modules
have
little
or
no
bonds
between
them
.
Another
way
of
achieving
this
effect
is
to
strengthen
the
bond
between
elements
of
the
same
module
by
maximizing
the
relationship
between
elements
of
the
same
module
.
Cohesion
is
the
concept
that
tries
to
capture
this
intramodule
[
79
,
88
]
.
With
cohesion
,
we
are
interested
in
determining
how
closely
the
elements
of
a
module
are
related
to
each
other
.
Cohesion
of
a
module
represents
how
tightly
bound
the
internal
elements
of
the
module
are
to
one
another
.
Cohesion
of
a
module
gives
the
designer
an
idea
about
whether
the
different
elements
of
a
module
belong
together
in
the
same
module
.
Cohesion
and
coupling
are
clearly
related
.
Usually
,
the
greater
the
cohesion
of
each
module
in
the
system
,
the
lower
the
coupling
between
modules
is
.
This
correlation
is
not
perfect
,
but
it
has
been
observed
in
practice
.
There
are
several
levels
of
cohesion
:
Coincidental
is
the
lowest
level
,
and
functional
is
the
highest
.
Coincidental
co-
hesion
occurs
when
there
is
no
meaningful
relationship
among
the
elements
of
a
module
.
Coincidental
cohesion
can
occur
if
an
existing
program
is
“
mod-
ularized
”
by
chopping
it
into
pieces
and
making
different
pieces
modules
.
If
a
module
is
created
to
save
duplicate
code
by
combining
some
part
of
code
that
occurs
at
many
different
places
,
that
module
is
likely
to
have
coincidental
cohesion
.
A
module
has
logical
cohesion
if
there
is
some
logical
relationship
between
the
elements
of
a
module
,
and
the
elements
perform
functions
that
fall
in
the
same
logical
class
.
A
typical
example
of
this
kind
of
cohesion
is
a
module
that
performs
all
the
inputs
or
all
the
outputs
.
In
such
a
situation
,
if
we
want
to
input
or
output
a
particular
record
,
we
have
to
somehow
convey
this
to
the
module
.
Often
,
this
will
be
done
by
passing
some
kind
of
special
status
flag
,
which
will
be
used
to
determine
what
statements
to
execute
in
the
module
.
Besides
resulting
in
hybrid
information
flow
between
modules
,
which
is
generally
the
worst
form
of
coupling
between
modules
,
such
a
module
will
usually
have
tricky
and
clumsy
code
.
In
general
,
logically
cohesive
modules
should
be
avoided
,
if
possible
.
Temporal
cohesion
is
the
same
as
logical
cohesion
,
except
that
the
elements
are
also
related
in
time
and
are
executed
together
.
Modules
that
perform
activ-
ities
like
“
initialization
,
”
“
cleanup
,
”
and
“
termination
”
are
usually
temporally
bound
.
Even
though
the
elements
in
a
temporally
bound
module
are
logically
related
,
temporal
cohesion
is
higher
than
logical
cohesion
,
because
the
elements
are
all
executed
together
.
This
avoids
the
problem
of
passing
the
flag
,
and
the
code
is
usually
simpler
.
A
procedurally
cohesive
module
contains
elements
that
belong
to
a
common
procedural
unit
.
For
example
,
a
loop
or
a
sequence
of
decision
statements
in
a
module
may
be
combined
to
form
a
separate
module
.
Procedurally
cohesive
modules
often
occur
when
modular
structure
is
determined
from
some
form
of
flowchart
.
Procedural
cohesion
often
cuts
across
functional
lines
.
A
module
with
only
procedural
cohesion
may
contain
only
part
of
a
complete
function
or
parts
of
several
functions
.
A
module
with
communicational
cohesion
has
elements
that
are
related
by
a
reference
to
the
same
input
or
output
data
.
That
is
,
in
a
communicationally
bound
module
,
the
elements
are
together
because
they
operate
on
the
same
input
or
output
data
.
An
example
of
this
could
be
a
module
to
“
print
and
punch
record.
”
Communicationally
cohesive
modules
may
perform
more
than
one
function
.
However
,
communicational
cohesion
is
sufficiently
high
as
to
be
generally
acceptable
if
alternative
structures
with
higher
cohesion
can
not
be
easily
identified
.
When
the
elements
are
together
in
a
module
because
the
output
of
one
forms
the
input
to
another
,
we
get
sequential
cohesion
.
If
we
have
a
sequence
of
elements
in
which
the
output
of
one
forms
the
input
to
another
,
sequential
cohesion
does
not
provide
any
guidelines
on
how
to
combine
them
into
modules
.
Functional
cohesion
is
the
strongest
cohesion
.
In
a
functionally
bound
mod-
ule
,
all
the
elements
of
the
module
are
related
to
performing
a
single
function
.
By
function
,
we
do
not
mean
simply
mathematical
functions
;
modules
accom-
plishing
a
single
goal
are
also
included
.
Functions
like
“
compute
square
root
”
and
“
sort
the
array
”
are
clear
examples
of
functionally
cohesive
modules
.
How
does
one
determine
the
cohesion
level
of
a
module
?
There
is
no
math-
ematical
formula
that
can
be
used
.
We
have
to
use
our
judgment
for
this
.
A
useful
technique
for
determining
if
a
module
has
functional
cohesion
is
to
write
a
sentence
that
describes
,
fully
and
accurately
,
the
function
or
purpose
of
the
module
.
Modules
with
functional
cohesion
can
always
be
described
by
a
simple
sentence
.
If
we
can
not
describe
it
using
a
simple
sentence
,
the
module
is
not
likely
to
have
functional
cohesion
.
Cohesion
in
object-oriented
systems
has
three
aspects
[
30
]
:
Method
cohesion
is
the
same
as
cohesion
in
functional
modules
.
It
focuses
on
why
the
different
code
elements
of
a
method
are
together
within
the
method
.
The
highest
form
of
cohesion
is
if
each
method
implements
a
clearly
defined
function
,
and
all
statements
in
the
method
contribute
to
implementing
this
function
.
Class
cohesion
focuses
on
why
different
attributes
and
methods
are
together
in
this
class
.
The
goal
is
to
have
a
class
that
implements
a
single
concept
or
abstraction
with
all
elements
contributing
toward
supporting
this
concept
.
In
general
,
whenever
there
are
multiple
concepts
encapsulated
within
a
class
,
the
cohesion
of
the
class
is
not
as
high
as
it
could
be
,
and
a
designer
should
try
to
change
the
design
to
have
each
class
encapsulate
a
single
concept
.
One
symptom
of
the
situation
where
a
class
has
multiple
abstractions
is
that
the
set
of
methods
can
be
partitioned
into
two
(
or
more
)
groups
,
each
accessing
a
distinct
subset
of
the
attributes
.
That
is
,
the
set
of
methods
and
attributes
can
be
partitioned
into
separate
groups
,
each
encapsulating
a
different
concept
.
Clearly
,
in
such
a
situation
,
by
having
separate
classes
encapsulating
separate
concepts
,
we
can
have
modules
with
improved
cohesion
.
In
many
situations
,
even
though
two
(
or
more
)
concepts
may
be
encapsu-
lated
within
a
class
,
there
are
some
methods
that
access
attributes
of
both
the
encapsulated
concepts
.
This
happens
when
the
class
represents
different
entities
which
have
a
relationship
between
them
.
For
cohesion
,
it
is
best
to
represent
them
as
two
separate
classes
with
relationship
among
them
.
That
is
,
we
should
have
multiple
classes
,
with
some
methods
in
these
classes
accessing
objects
of
the
other
class
.
In
a
way
,
this
improvement
in
cohesion
results
in
an
increased
coupling
.
However
,
for
modifiability
and
understandability
,
it
is
better
if
each
class
encapsulates
a
single
concept
.
Inheritance
cohesion
focuses
on
the
reason
why
classes
are
together
in
a
hierarchy
.
The
two
main
reasons
for
inheritance
are
to
model
generalization-
specialization
relationship
,
and
for
code
reuse
.
Cohesion
is
considered
high
if
the
hierarchy
supports
generalization-specialization
of
some
concept
(
which
is
likely
to
naturally
lead
to
reuse
of
some
code
)
.
It
is
considered
lower
if
the
hierarchy
is
primarily
for
sharing
code
with
weak
conceptual
relationship
between
superclass
and
subclasses
.
In
other
words
,
it
is
desired
that
in
an
OO
system
the
class
hierarchies
should
be
such
that
they
support
clearly
identified
generalization-specialization
relationship
.
This
is
a
design
concept
which
came
into
existence
more
in
the
OO
context
.
Like
with
cohesion
and
coupling
,
the
basic
goal
here
is
again
to
promote
build-
ing
of
systems
that
are
easily
modifiable
,
as
modification
and
change
happen
frequently
and
a
design
that
can
not
easily
accommodate
change
will
result
in
systems
that
will
die
fast
and
will
not
be
able
to
easily
adapt
to
the
changing
world
.
The
basic
principle
,
as
stated
by
Bertrand
Meyer
,
is
“
Software
entities
should
be
open
for
extension
,
but
closed
for
modification
”
[
66
]
.
A
module
being
“
open
for
extension
”
means
that
its
behavior
can
be
extended
to
accommodate
new
demands
placed
on
this
module
due
to
changes
in
requirements
and
sys-
tem
functionality
.
The
module
being
“
closed
for
modification
”
means
that
the
existing
source
code
of
the
module
is
not
changed
when
making
enhancements
.
Then
how
does
one
make
enhancements
to
a
module
without
changing
the
existing
source
code
?
This
principle
restricts
the
changes
to
modules
to
extension
only
,
i.e
.
it
allows
addition
of
code
,
but
disallows
changing
of
existing
code
.
If
this
can
be
done
,
clearly
,
the
value
is
tremendous
.
Code
changes
involve
heavy
risk
and
to
ensure
that
a
change
has
not
“
broken
”
things
that
were
working
often
requires
a
lot
of
regression
testing
.
This
risk
can
be
minimized
if
no
changes
are
made
to
existing
code
.
But
if
changes
are
not
made
,
how
will
enhancements
be
made
?
This
principle
says
that
enhancements
should
be
made
by
adding
new
code
,
rather
than
altering
old
code
.
There
is
another
side
benefit
of
this
.
Programmers
typically
prefer
writing
new
code
rather
than
modifying
old
code
.
But
the
reality
is
that
systems
that
are
being
built
today
are
being
built
on
top
of
existing
software
.
If
this
principle
is
satisfied
,
then
we
can
expand
existing
systems
by
mostly
adding
new
code
to
old
systems
,
and
minimizing
the
need
for
changing
code
.
This
principle
can
be
satisfied
in
OO
designs
by
properly
using
inheritance
and
polymorphism
.
Inheritance
allows
creating
new
classes
that
will
extend
the
behavior
of
existing
classes
without
changing
the
original
class
.
And
it
is
this
property
that
can
be
used
to
support
this
principle
.
As
an
example
,
consider
an
application
in
which
a
client
object
(
of
type
Client
)
interacts
with
a
printer
object
(
of
class
Printer1
)
and
invokes
the
necessary
methods
for
completing
its
printing
needs
.
The
class
diagram
for
this
will
be
as
shown
in
Figure
In
this
design
,
the
client
directly
calls
the
methods
on
the
printer
object
for
printing
something
.
Now
suppose
the
system
has
to
be
enhanced
to
allow
another
printer
to
be
used
by
the
client
.
Under
this
design
,
to
implement
this
change
,
a
new
class
Printer
.
This
design
does
not
support
the
open-closed
principle
as
the
Client
class
is
not
closed
against
change
.
The
design
for
this
system
,
however
,
can
be
done
in
another
manner
that
supports
the
open-closed
principle
.
In
this
design
,
instead
of
directly
imple-
menting
the
Printer
,
we
create
an
abstract
class
Printer
that
defines
the
interface
of
a
printer
and
specifies
all
the
methods
a
printer
object
should
sup-
port
.
Printer
.
In
this
design
,
when
Printer
,
it
is
added
as
another
subclass
of
type
Printer
.
The
client
does
not
need
to
be
aware
of
this
subtype
as
it
interacts
with
ob-
jects
of
type
Printer
.
That
is
,
the
client
only
deals
with
a
generic
Printer
,
and
its
interaction
is
the
same
whether
the
object
is
actually
of
type
Printer2
.
The
class
diagram
for
this
is
shown
in
Figure
It
is
this
inheritance
property
of
OO
that
is
leveraged
to
support
the
open-
closed
principle
.
The
basic
idea
is
to
have
a
class
encapsulate
the
abstraction
of
some
concept
.
If
this
abstraction
is
to
be
extended
,
the
extension
is
done
by
creating
new
subclasses
of
the
abstraction
,
thereby
keeping
all
the
existing
code
unchanged
.
If
inheritance
hierarchies
are
built
in
this
manner
,
they
are
said
to
satisfy
the
Liskov
Substitution
Principle
[
65
]
.
According
to
this
principle
,
if
a
program
is
using
object
o
(
base
)
class
C
,
that
program
should
remain
unchanged
if
o1
,
where
C.
If
this
principle
is
satisfied
for
class
hierarchies
,
and
hierarchies
are
used
prop-
erly
,
then
the
open-closed
principle
can
be
supported
.
It
should
also
be
noted
that
recommendations
for
both
inheritance
coupling
and
inheritance
cohesion
support
that
this
principle
be
followed
in
class
hierarchies
.
Creating
the
software
system
design
is
the
major
concern
of
the
design
phase
.
Many
design
techniques
have
been
proposed
over
the
years
to
provide
some
discipline
in
handling
the
complexity
of
designing
large
systems
.
The
aim
of
design
methodologies
is
not
to
reduce
the
process
of
design
to
a
sequence
of
mechanical
steps
but
to
provide
guidelines
to
aid
the
designer
during
the
design
process
.
We
discuss
the
structured
design
methodology
[
79
,
88
]
for
developing
function-oriented
system
designs
.
The
methodology
employs
the
structure
chart
notation
for
creating
the
design
.
So
before
we
discuss
the
methodology
,
we
describe
this
notation
.
Graphical
design
notations
are
frequently
used
during
the
design
process
to
represent
design
or
design
decisions
,
so
the
design
can
be
communicated
to
stakeholders
in
a
succinct
manner
and
evaluated
.
For
a
function-oriented
design
,
the
design
can
be
represented
graphically
by
structure
charts
.
The
structure
of
a
program
is
made
up
of
the
modules
of
that
program
together
with
the
interconnections
between
modules
.
Every
computer
program
has
a
structure
,
and
given
a
program
its
structure
can
be
determined
.
The
structure
chart
of
a
program
is
a
graphic
representation
of
its
structure
.
In
a
structure
chart
a
module
is
represented
by
a
box
with
the
module
name
written
in
the
box
.
An
arrow
from
module
A
to
module
B
represents
that
module
A
invokes
module
B
.
B
is
called
the
subordinate
of
A
,
and
A
is
called
the
superordinate
of
B
.
The
arrow
is
labeled
by
the
parameters
received
by
B
as
input
and
the
parameters
returned
by
B
as
output
,
with
the
direction
of
flow
of
the
input
and
output
parameters
represented
by
small
arrows
.
The
parameters
can
be
shown
to
be
data
(
unfilled
circle
at
the
tail
of
the
label
)
or
control
(
filled
circle
at
the
tail
)
.
As
an
example
,
consider
the
structure
of
the
following
program
,
whose
structure
is
shown
in
Figure
readnums
(
a
,
&
N
)
;
sort
(
a
,
N
)
;
scanf
(
&
n
)
;
sum
=
add_n
(
a
,
n
)
;
printf
(
sum
)
;
if
(
a
[
i
]
>
a
[
t
]
)
switch
(
a
[
i
]
,
a
[
t
]
)
;
/
*
Add
the
first
n
numbers
of
a
*
/
add_n
(
a
,
n
)
In
general
,
procedural
information
is
not
represented
in
a
structure
chart
,
and
the
focus
is
on
representing
the
hierarchy
of
modules
.
However
,
there
are
situations
where
the
designer
may
wish
to
communicate
certain
procedural
information
explicitly
,
like
major
loops
and
decisions
.
Such
information
can
also
be
represented
in
a
structure
chart
.
For
example
,
let
us
consider
a
situation
where
module
A
has
subordinates
B
,
C
,
and
D
,
and
A
repeatedly
calls
the
modules
C
and
D.
This
can
be
represented
by
a
looping
arrow
around
the
arrows
joining
the
subordinates
C
and
D
to
A
,
as
shown
in
Figure
All
the
subordinate
modules
activated
within
a
common
loop
are
enclosed
in
the
same
looping
arrow
.
Major
decisions
can
be
represented
similarly
.
For
example
,
if
the
invocation
of
modules
C
and
D
in
module
A
depends
on
the
outcome
of
some
decision
,
that
is
represented
by
a
small
diamond
in
the
box
for
A
,
with
the
arrows
joining
C
and
D
coming
out
of
this
diamond
,
as
shown
in
Figure
Modules
in
a
system
can
be
categorized
into
few
classes
.
There
are
some
modules
that
obtain
information
from
their
subordinates
and
then
pass
it
to
their
superordinate
.
This
kind
of
module
is
an
input
module
.
Similarly
,
there
are
output
modules
,
which
take
information
from
their
superordinate
and
pass
it
on
to
its
subordinates
.
As
the
names
suggest
,
the
input
and
output
mod-
ules
are
typically
used
for
input
and
output
of
data
from
and
to
the
environ-
ment
.
The
input
modules
get
the
data
from
the
sources
and
get
it
ready
to
be
processed
,
and
the
output
modules
take
the
output
produced
and
prepare
it
for
proper
presentation
to
the
environment
.
Then
there
are
modules
that
exist
solely
for
the
sake
of
transforming
data
into
some
other
form
.
Such
a
module
is
called
a
transform
module
.
Most
of
the
computational
modules
typically
fall
in
this
category
.
Finally
,
there
are
modules
whose
primary
concern
is
managing
the
flow
of
data
to
and
from
different
subordinates
.
Such
modules
are
called
coordinate
modules
.
A
module
can
perform
functions
of
more
than
one
type
of
module
.
A
structure
chart
is
a
nice
representation
for
a
design
that
uses
functional
abstraction
.
It
shows
the
modules
and
their
call
hierarchy
,
the
interfaces
be-
tween
the
modules
,
and
what
information
passes
between
modules
.
So
,
for
a
software
system
,
once
its
structure
is
decided
,
the
modules
and
their
interfaces
and
dependencies
get
fixed
.
The
objective
of
the
structured
design
methodology
is
to
control
the
eventual
structure
of
the
system
by
fixing
the
structure
dur-
ing
design
.
The
aim
is
to
design
a
system
so
that
programs
implementing
the
design
would
have
a
hierarchical
structure
,
with
functionally
cohesive
modules
and
as
few
interconnections
between
modules
as
possible
.
No
design
methodology
reduces
design
to
a
series
of
steps
that
can
be
mechan-
ically
executed
.
All
design
methodologies
are
,
at
best
,
a
set
of
guidelines
that
,
if
applied
,
will
most
likely
produce
a
design
that
is
modular
and
simple
.
The
basic
principle
behind
the
structured
design
methodology
,
as
with
most
other
methodologies
,
is
problem
partitioning
.
Structured
design
methodology
partitions
the
system
at
the
very
top
level
into
various
subsystems
,
one
for
managing
each
major
input
,
one
for
managing
each
major
output
,
and
one
for
each
major
transformation
.
The
modules
performing
the
transformation
deal
with
data
at
an
abstract
level
,
and
hence
can
focus
on
the
conceptual
problem
of
how
to
perform
the
transformation
without
bothering
with
how
to
obtain
clean
inputs
or
how
to
present
the
output
.
The
rationale
behind
this
partitioning
is
that
in
many
systems
,
particularly
data
processing
systems
,
a
good
part
of
the
system
code
deals
with
managing
the
inputs
and
outputs
.
The
modules
dealing
with
inputs
have
to
deal
with
issues
of
screens
,
reading
data
,
formats
,
errors
,
exceptions
,
completeness
of
information
,
structure
of
the
information
,
etc
.
Similarly
,
the
modules
dealing
with
output
have
to
prepare
the
output
in
presentation
formats
,
make
charts
,
produce
reports
,
etc
.
Hence
,
for
many
systems
,
it
is
indeed
the
case
that
a
good
part
of
the
software
has
to
deal
with
inputs
and
outputs
.
The
actual
transfor-
mation
in
the
system
is
frequently
not
very
complex—it
is
dealing
with
data
and
getting
it
in
proper
form
for
performing
the
transformation
or
producing
the
output
in
the
desired
form
that
requires
considerable
processing
.
This
partitioning
is
at
the
heart
of
the
structured
design
methodology
.
There
are
four
major
steps
in
the
methodology
:
Factoring
of
input
,
output
,
and
transform
branches
We
will
now
discuss
each
of
these
steps
in
more
detail
.
Restate
the
Problem
as
a
Data
Flow
Diagram
To
use
this
methodology
,
the
first
step
is
to
construct
the
data
flow
diagram
for
the
problem
.
We
studied
data
flow
diagrams
in
Chapter
3
.
However
,
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
DFDs
drawn
during
requirements
analysis
and
those
drawn
during
structured
design
.
In
the
requirements
analysis
,
a
DFD
is
drawn
to
model
the
problem
domain
.
The
analyst
has
little
control
over
the
problem
,
and
hence
his
task
is
to
extract
from
the
problem
all
the
information
and
then
represent
it
as
a
DFD
.
During
design
activity
,
we
are
no
longer
modeling
the
problem
domain
,
but
are
dealing
with
the
solution
domain
and
developing
a
model
for
the
eventual
system
.
That
is
,
the
DFD
during
design
represents
how
the
data
will
flow
in
the
system
when
it
is
built
.
In
this
modeling
,
the
major
transforms
or
functions
in
the
software
are
decided
,
and
the
DFD
shows
the
major
transforms
that
the
software
will
have
and
how
the
data
will
flow
through
different
transforms
.
A
DFD
of
an
ATM
is
shown
in
Figure
There
are
two
major
streams
of
input
data
in
this
diagram
.
The
first
is
the
account
number
and
the
code
,
and
the
second
is
the
amount
to
be
debited
.
Notice
the
use
of
*
at
different
places
in
the
DFD
.
For
example
,
the
trans-
form
“
validate
,
”
which
verifies
if
the
account
number
and
code
are
valid
,
needs
not
only
the
account
number
and
code
,
but
also
information
from
the
sys-
tem
database
to
do
the
validation
.
And
the
transform
debit
account
has
two
outputs
,
one
used
for
recording
the
transaction
and
the
other
to
update
the
account
.
Identify
the
Most
Abstract
Input
and
Output
Data
Elements
Most
systems
have
some
basic
transformations
that
perform
the
required
operations
.
How-
ever
,
in
most
cases
the
transformation
can
not
be
easily
applied
to
the
actual
physical
input
and
produce
the
desired
physical
output
.
Instead
,
the
input
is
first
converted
into
a
form
on
which
the
transformation
can
be
applied
with
ease
.
Similarly
,
the
main
transformation
modules
often
produce
outputs
that
have
to
be
converted
into
the
desired
physical
output
.
The
goal
of
this
second
step
is
to
separate
the
transforms
in
the
data
flow
diagram
that
convert
the
input
or
output
to
the
desired
format
from
the
ones
that
perform
the
actual
transformations
.
For
this
separation
,
once
the
data
flow
diagram
is
ready
,
the
next
step
is
to
identify
the
highest
abstract
level
of
input
and
output
.
The
most
abstract
input
data
elements
are
those
data
elements
in
the
data
flow
diagram
that
are
farthest
removed
from
the
physical
inputs
but
can
still
be
considered
inputs
to
the
system
.
The
most
abstract
input
data
elements
often
have
little
resem-
blance
to
the
actual
physical
data
.
These
are
often
the
data
elements
obtained
after
operations
like
error
checking
,
data
validation
,
proper
formatting
,
and
conversion
are
complete
.
Most
abstract
input
data
elements
are
recognized
by
starting
from
the
phys-
ical
inputs
and
traveling
toward
the
outputs
in
the
data
flow
diagram
,
until
the
data
elements
are
reached
that
can
no
longer
be
considered
incoming
.
The
aim
is
to
go
as
far
as
possible
from
the
physical
inputs
,
without
losing
the
incoming
nature
of
the
data
element
.
This
process
is
performed
for
each
input
stream
.
Identifying
the
most
abstract
data
items
represents
a
value
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
designer
,
but
often
the
choice
is
obvious
.
Similarly
,
we
identify
the
most
abstract
output
data
elements
by
starting
from
the
outputs
in
the
data
flow
diagram
and
traveling
toward
the
inputs
.
These
are
the
data
elements
that
are
most
removed
from
the
actual
outputs
but
can
still
be
considered
outgoing
.
These
data
elements
may
also
be
considered
the
logical
output
data
items
,
and
the
transforms
in
the
data
flow
diagram
after
these
data
items
are
basically
to
convert
the
logical
output
into
a
form
in
which
the
system
is
required
to
produce
the
output
.
There
will
usually
be
some
transforms
left
between
the
most
abstract
input
and
output
data
items
.
These
central
transforms
perform
the
basic
transforma-
tion
for
the
system
,
taking
the
most
abstract
input
and
transforming
it
into
the
most
abstract
output
.
The
purpose
of
having
central
transforms
deal
with
the
most
abstract
data
items
is
that
the
modules
implementing
these
transforms
can
concentrate
on
performing
the
transformation
without
being
concerned
with
converting
the
data
into
proper
format
,
validating
the
data
,
and
so
forth
.
Consider
now
the
data
flow
diagram
of
the
automated
teller
shown
in
Figure
The
two
most
abstract
inputs
are
the
dollar
amount
and
the
validated
account
number
.
The
validated
account
number
is
the
most
abstract
input
,
rather
than
the
account
number
read
in
,
as
it
is
still
the
input—but
with
a
guarantee
that
the
account
number
is
valid
.
The
two
abstract
outputs
are
obvious
.
The
abstract
inputs
and
outputs
are
marked
in
the
data
flow
diagram
.
First-Level
Factoring
Having
identified
the
central
transforms
and
the
most
abstract
input
and
output
data
items
,
we
are
ready
to
identify
some
modules
for
the
system
.
We
first
specify
a
main
module
,
whose
purpose
is
to
invoke
the
subordinates
.
The
main
module
is
therefore
a
coordinate
module
.
For
each
of
the
most
abstract
input
data
items
,
an
immediate
subordinate
module
to
the
main
module
is
specified
.
Each
of
these
modules
is
an
input
module
,
whose
purpose
is
to
deliver
to
the
main
module
the
most
abstract
data
item
for
which
it
is
created
.
Similarly
,
for
each
most
abstract
output
data
item
,
a
subordinate
module
that
is
an
output
module
that
accepts
data
from
the
main
module
is
specified
.
Each
of
the
arrows
connecting
these
input
and
output
subordinate
modules
is
labeled
with
the
respective
abstract
data
item
flowing
in
the
proper
direction
.
Finally
,
for
each
central
transform
,
a
module
subordinate
to
the
main
one
is
specified
.
These
modules
will
be
transform
modules
,
whose
purpose
is
to
accept
data
from
the
main
module
,
and
then
return
the
appropriate
data
back
to
the
main
module
.
The
data
items
coming
to
a
transform
module
from
the
main
module
are
on
the
incoming
arcs
of
the
corresponding
transform
in
the
data
flow
diagram
.
The
data
items
returned
are
on
the
outgoing
arcs
of
that
transform
.
Note
that
here
a
module
is
created
for
a
transform
,
while
input/output
modules
are
created
for
data
items
.
Let
us
examine
the
data
flow
diagram
of
the
ATM
.
We
have
already
seen
that
this
has
two
most
abstract
inputs
,
two
most
abstract
outputs
,
and
two
central
transforms
.
Drawing
a
module
for
each
of
these
,
we
get
the
structure
chart
shown
in
Figure
As
we
can
see
,
the
first-level
factoring
is
straightforward
,
after
the
most
abstract
input
and
output
data
items
are
identified
in
the
data
flow
diagram
.
The
main
module
is
the
overall
control
module
,
which
will
form
the
main
program
or
procedure
in
the
implementation
of
the
design
.
It
is
a
coordinate
module
that
invokes
the
input
modules
to
get
the
most
abstract
data
items
,
passes
these
to
the
appropriate
transform
modules
,
and
delivers
the
results
of
the
transform
modules
to
other
transform
modules
until
the
most
abstract
data
items
are
obtained
.
These
are
then
passed
to
the
output
modules
.
Factoring
the
Input
,
Output
,
and
Transform
Branches
The
first-level
factor-
ing
results
in
a
very
high
level
structure
,
where
each
subordinate
module
has
a
lot
of
processing
to
do
.
To
simplify
these
modules
,
they
must
be
factored
into
subordinate
modules
that
will
distribute
the
work
of
a
module
.
Each
of
the
input
,
output
,
and
transformation
modules
must
be
considered
for
factoring
.
Let
us
start
with
the
input
modules
.
The
purpose
of
an
input
module
,
as
viewed
by
the
main
program
,
is
to
produce
some
data
.
To
factor
an
input
module
,
the
transform
in
the
data
flow
diagram
that
produced
the
data
item
is
now
treated
as
a
central
transform
.
The
process
performed
for
the
first-level
factoring
is
repeated
here
with
this
new
central
transform
,
with
the
input
module
being
considered
the
main
module
.
A
subordinate
input
module
is
created
for
each
input
data
stream
coming
into
this
new
central
transform
,
and
a
subordinate
transform
module
is
created
for
the
new
central
transform
.
The
new
input
modules
now
created
can
then
be
factored
again
,
until
the
physical
inputs
are
reached
.
Factoring
of
input
modules
will
usually
not
yield
any
output
subordinate
modules
.
The
factoring
of
the
output
modules
is
symmetrical
to
the
factoring
of
the
input
modules
.
For
an
output
module
we
look
at
the
next
transform
to
be
applied
to
the
output
to
bring
it
closer
to
the
ultimate
desired
output
.
This
now
becomes
the
central
transform
,
and
an
output
module
is
created
for
each
data
stream
going
out
of
this
transform
.
During
the
factoring
of
output
modules
,
there
will
usually
be
no
input
modules
.
If
the
data
flow
diagram
of
the
problem
is
sufficiently
detailed
,
factoring
of
the
input
and
output
modules
is
straightforward
.
However
,
there
are
no
such
rules
for
factoring
the
central
transforms
.
The
goal
is
to
determine
subtrans-
forms
that
will
together
compose
the
overall
transform
and
then
repeat
the
process
for
the
newly
found
transforms
,
until
we
reach
the
atomic
modules
.
Factoring
the
central
transform
is
essentially
an
exercise
in
functional
decom-
position
and
will
depend
on
the
designers
’
experience
and
judgment
.
One
way
to
factor
a
transform
module
is
to
treat
it
as
a
problem
in
its
own
right
and
start
with
a
data
flow
diagram
for
it
.
The
inputs
to
the
data
flow
diagram
are
the
data
coming
into
the
module
and
the
outputs
are
the
data
being
returned
by
the
module
.
Each
transform
in
this
data
flow
diagram
represents
a
subtransform
of
this
transform
.
The
central
transform
can
be
factored
by
creating
a
subordinate
transform
module
for
each
of
the
transforms
in
this
data
flow
diagram
.
This
process
can
be
repeated
for
the
new
transform
modules
that
are
created
,
until
we
reach
atomic
modules
.
As
an
example
,
consider
the
problem
of
determining
the
number
of
different
words
in
an
input
file
.
The
data
flow
diagram
for
this
problem
is
shown
in
Figure
This
problem
has
only
one
input
data
stream
,
the
input
file
,
while
the
desired
output
is
the
count
of
different
words
in
the
file
.
To
transform
the
input
to
the
desired
output
,
the
first
thing
we
do
is
form
a
list
of
all
the
words
in
the
file
.
It
is
best
to
then
sort
the
list
,
as
this
will
make
identifying
different
words
easier
.
This
sorted
list
is
then
used
to
count
the
number
of
different
words
,
and
the
output
of
this
transform
is
the
desired
count
,
which
is
then
printed
.
This
sequence
of
data
transformation
is
what
we
have
in
the
data
flow
diagram
.
The
arcs
in
the
data
flow
diagram
are
the
most
abstract
input
and
most
abstract
output
.
The
choice
of
the
most
abstract
input
is
obvious
.
We
start
following
the
input
.
First
,
the
input
file
is
converted
into
a
word
list
,
which
is
essentially
the
input
in
a
different
form
.
The
sorted
word
list
is
still
basically
the
input
,
as
it
is
still
the
same
list
,
in
a
different
order
.
This
appears
to
be
the
most
abstract
input
because
the
next
data
(
i.e.
,
count
)
is
not
just
another
form
of
the
input
data
.
The
choice
of
the
most
abstract
output
is
even
more
obvious
;
count
is
the
natural
choice
(
a
data
that
is
a
form
of
input
will
not
usually
be
a
candidate
for
the
most
abstract
output
)
.
Thus
,
we
have
one
cen-
tral
transform
,
count-number-of-different-words
,
which
has
one
input
and
one
output
data
item
.
The
structure
chart
after
the
first-level
factoring
of
the
word
counting
prob-
lem
is
shown
in
Figure
In
this
structure
,
there
is
one
input
module
,
which
returns
the
sorted
word
list
to
the
main
module
.
The
output
module
takes
from
the
main
module
the
value
of
the
count
.
There
is
only
one
central
transform
in
this
example
,
and
a
module
is
drawn
for
that
.
Note
that
the
data
items
traveling
to
and
from
this
transformation
module
are
the
same
as
the
data
items
going
in
and
out
of
the
central
transform
.
The
factoring
of
the
input
module
get-sorted-list
in
the
first-level
structure
is
shown
in
Figure
The
transform
producing
the
input
returned
by
this
module
(
i.e.
,
the
sort
transform
)
is
treated
as
a
central
transform
.
Its
input
is
the
word
list
.
Thus
,
in
the
first
factoring
we
have
an
input
module
to
get
the
list
and
a
transform
module
to
sort
the
list
.
The
input
module
can
be
factored
further
,
as
the
module
needs
to
perform
two
functions
,
getting
a
word
and
then
adding
it
to
the
list
.
Note
that
the
looping
arrow
is
used
to
show
the
iteration
.
In
this
example
,
there
is
only
one
transform
after
the
most
abstract
output
,
so
factoring
for
output
need
not
be
done
.
The
factoring
of
the
central
transform
count-the-number-of-different-words
is
shown
in
Figure
This
was
a
relatively
simple
transform
,
and
we
did
not
need
to
draw
the
data
flow
diagram
.
To
determine
the
number
of
words
,
we
have
to
get
a
word
repeatedly
,
determine
if
it
is
the
same
as
the
previous
word
(
for
a
sorted
list
,
this
checking
is
sufficient
to
determine
if
the
word
is
different
from
other
words
)
,
and
then
count
the
word
if
it
is
different
.
For
each
of
the
three
different
functions
,
we
have
a
subordinate
module
,
and
we
get
the
structure
shown
in

Object-oriented
(
OO
)
approaches
for
software
development
have
become
ex-
tremely
popular
in
recent
years
.
Much
of
the
new
development
is
now
being
done
using
OO
techniques
and
languages
.
There
are
many
advantages
that
OO
systems
offer
.
An
OO
model
closely
represents
the
problem
domain
,
which
makes
it
easier
to
produce
and
understand
designs
.
As
requirements
change
,
the
objects
in
a
system
are
less
immune
to
these
changes
,
thereby
permitting
changes
more
easily
.
Inheritance
and
close
association
of
objects
in
design
to
problem
domain
entities
encourage
more
re-use
,
i.e.
,
new
applications
can
use
existing
modules
more
effectively
,
thereby
reducing
development
cost
and
cycle
time
.
Object-oriented
approaches
are
believed
to
be
more
natural
and
provide
richer
structures
for
thinking
and
abstraction
.
Common
design
patterns
have
also
been
uncovered
that
allow
reusability
at
a
higher
level
.
(
Design
patterns
is
an
advanced
topic
which
we
will
not
discuss
further
;
interested
readers
are
referred
to
[
38
]
.
)
The
object-oriented
design
approach
is
fundamentally
different
from
the
function-oriented
design
approaches
primarily
due
to
the
different
abstraction
that
is
used
.
It
requires
a
different
way
of
thinking
and
partitioning
.
It
can
be
said
that
thinking
in
object-oriented
terms
is
most
important
for
producing
truly
object-oriented
designs
.
In
this
section
,
we
will
first
discuss
some
important
concepts
that
form
the
basis
of
object-orientation
.
We
will
then
describe
the
UML
notation
that
can
be
used
while
doing
an
object-oriented
design
,
followed
by
an
OO
design
methodology
.
Here
we
very
briefly
discuss
the
main
concepts
behind
object-orientation
.
Read-
ers
familiar
with
an
OO
language
will
be
familiar
with
these
concepts
.
Classes
and
Objects
Classes
and
objects
are
the
basic
building
blocks
of
an
OO
design
,
just
like
functions
(
and
procedures
)
are
for
a
function-oriented
design
.
Objects
are
entities
that
encapsulate
some
state
and
provide
services
to
be
used
by
a
client
,
which
could
be
another
object
,
program
,
or
a
user
.
The
basic
property
of
an
object
is
encapsulation
:
it
encapsulates
the
data
and
information
it
contains
and
supports
a
well-defined
abstraction
.
The
set
of
services
that
can
be
requested
from
outside
the
object
forms
the
interface
of
the
object
.
An
object
may
have
operations
defined
only
for
internal
use
that
can
not
be
used
from
outside
.
Such
operations
do
not
form
part
of
the
interface
.
A
major
advantage
of
encapsulation
is
that
access
to
the
encapsulated
data
is
limited
to
the
operations
defined
on
the
data
.
Hence
,
it
becomes
much
easier
to
ensure
that
the
integrity
of
data
is
preserved
,
something
very
hard
to
do
if
any
program
from
outside
can
directly
manipulate
the
data
structures
of
an
object
.
Encapsulation
and
separation
of
the
interface
and
its
implementation
,
also
allows
the
implementation
to
be
changed
without
affecting
the
clients
as
long
as
the
interface
is
preserved
.
The
encapsulated
data
for
an
object
defines
the
state
of
the
object
.
An
important
property
of
objects
is
that
this
state
persists
,
in
contrast
to
the
data
defined
in
a
function
or
procedure
,
which
is
generally
lost
once
the
function
stops
being
active
(
finishes
its
current
execution
)
.
In
an
object
,
the
state
is
preserved
and
it
persists
through
the
life
of
the
object
,
i.e.
,
unless
the
object
is
actively
destroyed
.
The
state
and
services
of
an
object
together
define
its
behavior
.
We
can
say
that
the
behavior
of
an
object
is
how
an
object
reacts
in
terms
of
state
changes
when
it
is
acted
on
,
and
how
it
acts
on
other
objects
by
requesting
services
and
operations
.
Generally
,
for
an
object
,
the
defined
operations
together
specify
the
behavior
of
the
object
.
Objects
represent
the
basic
runtime
entities
in
an
OO
system
;
they
occupy
space
in
memory
that
keeps
its
state
and
is
operated
on
by
the
defined
opera-
tions
on
the
object
.
A
class
,
on
the
other
hand
,
defines
a
possible
set
of
objects
.
We
have
seen
that
objects
have
some
attributes
,
whose
values
constitute
much
of
the
state
of
an
object
.
What
attributes
an
object
has
are
defined
by
the
class
of
the
object
.
Similarly
,
the
operations
allowed
on
an
object
or
the
services
it
provides
,
are
defined
by
the
class
of
the
object
.
But
a
class
is
merely
a
definition
that
does
not
create
any
objects
and
can
not
hold
any
values
.
Each
object
,
when
it
is
created
,
gets
a
private
copy
of
the
instance
variables
,
and
when
an
operation
defined
on
the
class
is
performed
on
the
object
,
it
is
performed
on
the
state
of
the
particular
object
.
The
relationship
between
a
class
and
objects
of
that
class
is
similar
to
the
relationship
between
a
type
and
elements
of
that
type
.
A
class
represents
a
set
of
objects
that
share
a
common
structure
and
a
common
behavior
,
whereas
an
object
is
an
instance
of
a
class
.
Relationships
among
Objects
An
object
,
as
a
stand-alone
entity
,
has
very
limited
capabilities—it
can
only
provide
the
services
defined
on
it
.
Any
complex
system
will
be
composed
of
many
objects
of
different
classes
,
and
these
objects
will
interact
with
each
other
so
that
the
overall
system
objectives
are
met
.
In
object-oriented
systems
,
an
object
interacts
with
another
by
sending
a
message
to
the
object
to
perform
some
service
it
provides
.
On
receiving
the
request
message
,
the
object
invokes
the
requested
service
or
the
method
and
sends
the
result
,
if
needed
.
This
form
of
client-server
interaction
is
a
direct
fall
out
of
encapsulation
and
abstraction
supported
by
objects
.
If
an
object
invokes
some
services
in
other
objects
,
we
can
say
that
the
two
objects
are
related
in
some
way
to
each
other
.
If
an
object
uses
some
services
of
another
object
,
there
is
an
association
between
the
two
objects
.
This
association
is
also
called
a
link—a
link
exists
from
one
object
to
another
if
the
object
uses
some
services
of
the
other
object
.
Links
frequently
show
up
as
pointers
when
programming
.
A
link
captures
the
fact
that
a
message
is
flowing
from
one
object
to
another
.
However
,
when
a
link
exists
,
though
the
message
flows
in
the
direction
of
the
link
,
information
can
flow
in
both
directions
(
e.g.
,
the
server
may
return
some
results
)
.
With
associations
comes
the
issue
of
visibility
,
that
is
,
which
object
is
visible
to
whom
.
The
basic
issue
here
is
that
if
there
is
a
link
from
object
A
to
object
B
,
for
A
(
client
object
)
to
be
able
to
send
a
message
to
B
(
supplier
object
)
,
B
must
be
visible
to
A
in
the
final
program
.
There
are
different
ways
to
provide
this
visibility
.
Some
of
the
important
possibilities
are
[
15
]
:
The
supplier
object
is
a
parameter
to
some
operation
of
the
client
that
sends
the
message
.
The
supplier
object
is
a
part
of
the
client
object
.
The
supplier
object
is
locally
declared
in
some
operation
.
Links
between
objects
capture
the
client/server
type
of
relationship
.
An-
other
type
of
relationship
between
objects
is
aggregation
,
which
reflects
the
whole/part-of
relationship
.
Though
not
necessary
,
aggregation
generally
im-
plies
containment
.
That
is
,
if
an
object
A
is
an
aggregation
of
objects
B
and
C
,
then
objects
B
and
C
will
generally
be
within
object
A
(
though
there
are
situa-
tions
where
the
conceptual
relationship
of
aggregation
may
not
get
reflected
as
actual
containment
of
objects
)
.
The
main
implication
of
this
is
that
a
contained
object
can
not
survive
without
its
containing
object
.
With
links
,
that
is
not
the
case
.
Inheritance
and
Polymorphism
Inheritance
is
a
relation
between
classes
that
allows
for
definition
and
implementation
of
one
class
based
on
the
definition
of
existing
classes
[
62
]
.
When
a
class
B
inherits
from
another
class
A
,
B
is
referred
to
as
the
subclass
or
the
derived
class
and
A
is
referred
to
as
the
superclass
or
the
base
class
.
In
general
,
a
subclass
B
will
have
two
parts
:
a
derived
part
and
an
incremental
part
[
62
]
.
The
derived
part
is
the
part
inherited
from
A
and
the
incremental
part
is
the
new
code
and
definitions
that
have
been
specifically
added
for
B
.
This
is
shown
in
Figure
[
62
]
.
Objects
of
type
B
have
the
derived
part
as
well
as
the
incremental
part
.
Hence
,
by
defining
only
the
incremental
part
and
inheriting
the
derived
part
from
an
existing
class
,
we
can
define
objects
that
contain
both
.
Inheritance
is
often
called
an
“
is
a
”
relation
,
implying
that
an
object
of
type
B
is
also
an
instance
of
type
A
.
That
is
,
an
instance
of
a
subclass
,
though
more
than
an
instance
of
the
superclass
,
is
also
an
instance
of
the
superclass
.
The
inheritance
relation
between
classes
forms
a
hierarchy
.
As
discussed
earlier
,
it
is
important
that
the
hierarchy
represent
a
structure
present
in
the
application
domain
and
is
not
created
simply
to
reuse
some
parts
of
an
existing
class
.
And
the
hierarchy
should
be
such
that
an
object
of
a
class
is
also
an
object
of
all
its
superclasses
in
the
problem
domain
.
The
power
of
inheritance
lies
in
the
fact
that
all
common
features
of
the
subclasses
can
be
accumulated
in
the
superclass
.
In
other
words
,
a
feature
is
placed
in
the
higher
level
of
abstractions
.
Once
this
is
done
,
such
features
can
be
inherited
from
the
parent
class
and
used
in
the
subclass
directly
.
This
implies
that
if
there
are
many
abstract
class
definitions
available
,
when
a
new
class
is
needed
,
it
is
possible
that
the
new
class
is
a
specialization
of
one
or
more
of
the
existing
classes
.
In
that
case
,
the
existing
class
can
be
tailored
through
inheritance
to
define
the
new
class
.
Inheritance
can
be
broadly
classified
as
being
of
two
types
:
strict
inheritance
and
nonstrict
inheritance
[
77
]
.
In
strict
inheritance
a
subclass
takes
all
the
features
from
the
parent
class
and
adds
additional
features
to
specialize
it
.
That
is
,
all
data
members
and
operations
available
in
the
base
class
are
also
available
in
the
derived
class
.
This
form
supports
the
“
is-a
”
relation
and
is
the
easiest
form
of
inheritance
.
Nonstrict
inheritance
occurs
when
the
subclass
does
not
have
all
the
features
of
the
parent
class
or
some
features
have
been
redefined
.
These
forms
do
not
satisfy
Liskov
’
s
substitution
principle
.
A
class
hierarchy
need
not
be
a
simple
tree
structure
.
It
may
be
a
graph
,
which
implies
that
a
class
may
inherit
from
multiple
classes
.
This
type
of
in-
heritance
,
when
a
subclass
inherits
from
many
superclasses
,
is
called
multiple
inheritance
.
Multiple
inheritance
complicates
matters
and
its
use
is
generally
discouraged
.
We
will
assume
that
multiple
inheritance
is
not
to
be
used
.
Inheritance
brings
in
polymorphism
,
a
general
concept
widely
used
in
type
theory
,
that
deals
with
the
ability
of
an
object
to
be
of
different
types
.
In
OO
programming
,
polymorphism
comes
in
the
form
that
a
reference
can
refer
to
objects
of
different
types
at
different
times
.
In
object-oriented
systems
,
with
inheritance
,
polymorphism
can
not
be
avoided—it
must
be
supported
.
The
rea-
son
is
the
“
is
a
”
relation
supported
by
inheritance—an
object
x
declared
to
be
of
class
B
is
also
an
object
of
any
class
A
that
is
the
superclass
of
B
.
Hence
,
anywhere
an
instance
of
A
is
expected
,
x
can
be
used
.
With
polymorphism
,
an
entity
has
a
static
type
and
a
dynamic
type
[
62
]
.
The
static
type
of
an
object
is
the
type
of
which
the
object
is
declared
in
the
program
text
,
and
it
remains
unchanged
.
The
dynamic
type
of
an
entity
,
on
the
other
hand
,
can
change
from
time
to
time
and
is
known
only
at
reference
time
.
Once
an
entity
is
declared
,
at
compile
time
the
set
of
types
that
this
entity
belongs
to
can
be
determined
from
the
inheritance
hierarchy
that
has
been
defined
.
The
dynamic
type
of
the
object
will
be
one
of
this
set
,
but
the
actual
dynamic
type
will
be
defined
at
the
time
of
reference
of
the
object
.
This
type
of
polymorphism
requires
dynamic
binding
of
operations
.
Dy-
namic
binding
means
that
the
code
associated
with
a
given
procedure
call
is
not
known
until
the
moment
of
the
call
[
62
]
.
Let
us
illustrate
with
an
example
.
Suppose
x
is
a
polymorphic
reference
whose
static
type
is
B
but
whose
dynamic
type
could
be
either
A
or
B
.
Suppose
that
an
operation
O
(
)
is
defined
in
the
class
A
,
which
is
redefined
in
the
class
B
.
Now
when
the
operation
O
(
)
is
in-
voked
on
x
,
it
is
not
known
statically
what
code
will
be
executed
.
That
is
,
the
code
to
be
executed
for
the
statement
x.O
(
)
is
decided
at
runtime
,
depending
on
the
dynamic
type
of
x—if
the
dynamic
type
is
A
,
the
code
for
the
operation
O
(
)
in
class
A
will
be
executed
;
if
the
dynamic
type
is
B
,
the
code
for
opera-
tion
O
(
)
in
class
B
will
be
executed
.
This
dynamic
binding
can
be
used
quite
effectively
during
application
development
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
code
.
This
feature
polymorphism
,
which
is
essentially
overloading
of
the
feature
(
i.e.
,
a
feature
can
mean
different
things
in
different
contexts
and
its
exact
meaning
is
determined
only
at
runtime
)
causes
no
problem
in
strict
inheri-
tance
because
all
features
of
a
superclass
are
available
in
the
subclasses
.
But
in
nonstrict
inheritance
,
it
can
cause
problems
,
because
a
child
may
lose
a
feature
.
Because
the
binding
of
the
feature
is
determined
at
runtime
,
this
can
cause
a
runtime
error
as
a
situation
may
arise
where
the
object
is
bound
to
the
superclass
in
which
the
feature
is
not
present
.
UML
is
a
graphical
notation
for
expressing
object-oriented
designs
[
35
]
.
It
is
called
a
modeling
language
and
not
a
design
notation
as
it
allows
representing
various
aspects
of
the
system
,
not
just
the
design
that
has
to
be
implemented
.
For
an
OO
design
,
a
specification
of
the
classes
that
exist
in
the
system
might
suffice
.
However
,
while
modeling
,
during
the
design
process
,
the
designer
also
tries
to
understand
how
the
different
classes
are
related
and
how
they
interact
to
provide
the
desired
functionality
.
This
aspect
of
modeling
helps
build
designs
that
are
more
likely
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
system
.
Due
to
the
ability
of
UML
to
create
different
models
,
it
has
become
an
aid
for
understanding
the
system
,
designing
the
system
,
as
well
as
a
notation
for
representing
design
.
Though
UML
has
now
evolved
into
a
fairly
comprehensive
and
large
mod-
eling
notation
,
we
will
focus
on
a
few
central
concepts
and
notations
relating
to
classes
and
their
relationships
and
interactions
.
For

detailed
discussion
on
UML

Class
Diagram
The
class
diagram
of
UML
is
the
central
piece
in
a
design
or
model
.
As
the
name
suggests
,
these
diagrams
describe
the
classes
that
are
there
in
the
design
.
As
the
final
code
of
an
OO
implementation
is
mostly
classes
,
these
diagrams
have
a
very
close
relationship
with
the
final
code
.
There
are
many
tools
that
translate
the
class
diagrams
to
code
skeletons
,
thereby
avoiding
errors
that
might
get
introduced
if
the
class
diagrams
are
manually
translated
to
class
definitions
by
programmers
.
A
class
diagram
defines
Classes
that
exist
in
the
system—besides
the
class
name
,
the
diagrams
are
capable
of
describing
the
key
fields
as
well
as
the
important
methods
of
the
classes
.
Associations
between
classes—what
types
of
associations
exist
between
dif-
ferent
classes
.
Subtype
,
supertype
relationship—classes
may
also
form
subtypes
giving
type
hierarchies
using
polymorphism
.
The
class
diagrams
can
represent
these
hierarchies
also
.
A
class
itself
is
represented
as
a
rectangular
box
which
is
divided
into
three
areas
.
The
top
part
gives
the
class
name
.
By
convention
the
class
name
is
a
word
with
the
first
letter
in
uppercase
.
(
In
general
,
if
the
class
name
is
a
combination
of
many
words
,
then
the
first
letter
of
each
word
is
in
uppercase
.
)
The
middle
part
lists
the
key
attributes
or
fields
of
the
class
.
These
attributes
are
the
state
holders
for
the
objects
of
the
class
.
By
convention
,
the
name
of
the
attributes
starts
in
lowercase
,
and
if
multiple
words
are
joined
,
then
each
new
word
starts
in
uppercase
.
The
bottom
part
lists
the
methods
or
operations
of
the
class
.
These
represent
the
behavior
that
the
class
can
provide
.
Naming
convention
is
same
as
for
attributes
but
to
show
that
it
is
a
function
,
the
names
end
with
“
(
)
”
.
(
The
parameters
of
the
methods
can
also
be
specified
,
if
desired
.
)
If
a
class
is
an
interface
(
having
specifications
but
no
body
,
)
this
can
be
specified
by
marking
the
class
with
the
stereotype
“
<
<
interface
>
>
”
,
which
is
generally
written
above
the
class
name
.
Similarly
,
if
a
class/method/attribute
has
some
properties
that
we
want
to
specify
,
it
can
be
done
by
tagging
the
entity
by
specifying
the
property
next
to
the
entity
name
within
“
{
”
and
“
}
”
or
by
using
some
special
symbol
.
Examples
of
a
class
with
some
tagged
values
,
and
an
interface
,
are
shown
in
Figure
Figure
6.12
:
Class
,
stereotypes
,
and
tagged
values
.
The
divided-box
notation
is
to
describe
the
key
features
of
a
class
as
a
stand-alone
entity
.
However
,
classes
have
relationships
between
them
,
and
ob-
jects
of
different
classes
interact
.
Therefore
,
to
model
a
system
or
an
applica-
tion
,
we
must
represent
relationship
between
classes
.
One
common
relationship
is
the
generalization-specialization
relationship
between
classes
,
which
finally
gets
reflected
as
the
inheritance
hierarchy
.
In
this
hierarchy
,
properties
of
gen-
eral
significance
are
assigned
to
a
more
general
class—the
superclass—while
properties
which
can
specialize
an
object
further
are
put
in
the
subclass
.
All
properties
of
the
superclass
are
inherited
by
the
subclass
,
so
a
subclass
contains
its
own
properties
as
well
as
those
of
the
superclass
.
The
generalization-specialization
relationship
is
specified
by
having
arrows
coming
from
the
subclass
to
the
superclass
,
with
the
empty
triangle-shaped
arrowhead
touching
the
superclass
.
Often
,
when
there
are
multiple
subclasses
of
a
class
,
this
may
be
specified
by
having
one
arrowhead
on
the
superclass
,
and
then
drawing
lines
from
this
to
the
different
subclasses
.
In
this
hierarchy
,
often
specialization
is
done
on
the
basis
of
some
discriminator—a
distinguishing
property
that
is
used
to
specialize
superclass
into
different
subclasses
.
In
other
words
,
by
using
the
discriminator
,
objects
of
the
superclass
type
are
partitioned
into
sets
of
objects
of
different
subclass
types
.
The
discriminator
used
for
the
generalization-specialization
relationship
can
be
specified
by
labeling
the
arrow
.
An
example
of
how
this
relationship
is
modeled
in
UML
is
shown
in
Figure
In
this
example
,
the
IITKPerson
class
represents
all
people
belonging
to
the
IITK
.
These
are
broadly
divided
into
two
subclasses—Student
and
Employee
,
as
both
these
types
have
many
different
properties
(
some
com-
mon
ones
also
)
and
different
behavior
.
Similarly
,
students
have
two
different
subclasses
,
UnderGraduate
and
PostGraduate
,
both
requiring
some
different
attributes
and
having
different
constraints
.
The
Employee
class
has
subtypes
representing
the
faculty
,
staff
,
and
research
staff
.
(
This
hierarchy
is
from
an
actual
working
system
developed
for
the
Institute
.
)
Besides
the
generalization-specialization
relationship
,
another
common
re-
lationship
is
association
,
which
allows
objects
to
communicate
with
each
other
.
An
association
between
two
classes
means
that
an
object
of
one
class
needs
some
services
from
objects
of
the
other
class
to
perform
its
own
service
.
The
relationship
is
that
of
peers
in
that
objects
of
both
the
classes
can
use
services
of
the
other
.
The
association
is
shown
by
a
line
between
the
two
classes
.
An
association
may
have
a
name
which
can
be
specified
by
labeling
the
association
line
.
(
The
association
can
also
be
assigned
some
attributes
of
its
own
.
)
And
if
the
roles
of
the
two
ends
of
the
association
need
to
be
named
,
that
can
also
be
done
.
In
an
association
,
an
end
may
also
have
multiplicity
allowing
rela-
tionships
like
1
,
,
etc.
,
to
be
modeled
.
Where
there
is
a
fixed
multiplicity
,
it
is
represented
by
putting
a
number
at
that
end
;
a
zero
or
many
multiplicity
is
represented
by
a
“
*
”
.
Figure

:
Aggregation
and
association
among
classes
.
Another
type
of
relationship
is
the
part-whole
relationship
which
represents
the
situation
when
an
object
is
composed
of
many
parts
,
each
part
itself
being
an
object
.
This
situation
represents
containment
or
aggregation
,
i.e.
,
object
of
a
class
is
contained
inside
the
object
of
another
class
.
(
Containment
and
ag-
gregation
can
be
treated
separately
and
shown
differently
,
but
we
will
consider
them
as
the
same
.
)
For
representing
this
aggregation
relationship
,
the
class
which
represents
the
“
whole
”
is
shown
at
the
top
and
a
line
emanating
from
a
little
diamond
connecting
it
to
classes
which
represent
the
parts
.
Often
in
an
implementation
this
relationship
is
implemented
in
the
same
manner
as
an
as-
sociation
,
hence
,
this
relationship
is
also
sometimes
modeled
as
an
association
.
The
association
and
aggregation
are
shown
in
Figure
expanding
the
example
given
above
.
An
object
of
IITKPerson
type
contains
two
objects
of
type
Address
,
representing
the
permanent
address
and
the
current
address
.
It
also
contains
an
object
of
type
BiometricInfo
,
which
keeps
information
like
the
person
’
s
picture
and
signature
.
As
these
objects
are
common
to
all
people
,
they
belong
in
the
parent
class
rather
than
a
subclass
.
An
IITKPerson
is
allowed
to
take
some
advances
from
the
Institute
to
meet
expenses
for
travel
,
medical
,
etc
.
Hence
,
Advances
is
a
different
class
(
which
,
incidently
,
has
a
hierarchy
of
its
own
)
to
which
IITKPerson
class
has
a
1-to-m
association
.
(
These
relations
Class
diagrams
focus
on
classes
,
and
should
not
be
confused
with
object
diagram
.
Objects
are
specific
instances
of
classes
.
Sometimes
,
it
is
desirable
to
model
specific
objects
and
the
relationship
between
them
,
and
for
that
object
diagrams
are
used
.
An
object
is
represented
like
a
class
,
except
that
its
name
also
specifies
the
name
of
the
class
to
which
it
belongs
.
Generally
,
the
object
name
starts
in
lowercase
,
and
the
class
name
is
specified
after
a
colon
.
To
further
clarify
,
the
entire
name
is
underlined
.
An
example
is
myList
:
List
.
The
attributes
of
an
object
may
have
specific
values
.
These
values
can
be
specified
by
giving
them
along
with
the
attribute
name
(
e.g.
,
name
=
“
John
”
)
.
Sequence
and
Collaboration
Diagrams
Class
diagrams
represent
the
static
structure
of
the
system
.
That
is
,
they
capture
the
structure
of
the
code
that
may
implement
it
,
and
how
the
different
classes
in
the
code
are
related
.
Class
diagrams
,
however
,
do
not
represent
the
dynamic
behavior
of
the
system
.
That
is
,
how
the
system
behaves
when
it
performs
some
of
its
functions
can
not
be
represented
by
class
diagrams
.
This
is
done
through
sequence
diagrams
or
collaboration
diagrams
,
together
called
interaction
diagrams
.
An
interaction
diagram
typically
captures
the
behavior
of
a
use
case
and
models
how
the
different
objects
in
the
system
collaborate
to
implement
the
use
case
.
Let
us
first
discuss
sequence
diagrams
,
which
is
perhaps
more
common
of
the
two
interaction
diagrams
.
A
sequence
diagram
shows
the
series
of
messages
exchanged
between
some
objects
,
and
their
temporal
ordering
,
when
objects
collaborate
to
provide
some
desired
system
functionality
(
or
implement
a
use
case
)
.
The
sequence
diagram
is
generally
drawn
to
model
the
interaction
between
objects
for
a
particular
use
case
.
Note
that
in
a
sequence
diagram
(
and
also
in
collaboration
diagrams
)
,
it
is
objects
that
participate
and
not
classes
.
When
capturing
dynamic
behavior
,
the
role
of
classes
are
limited
as
during
execution
it
is
objects
that
exist
.
In
a
sequence
diagram
,
all
the
objects
that
participate
in
the
interaction
are
shown
at
the
top
as
boxes
with
object
names
.
For
each
object
,
a
vertical
bar
representing
its
lifeline
is
drawn
downwards
.
A
message
from
one
object
to
another
is
represented
as
an
arrow
from
the
lifeline
of
one
to
the
lifeline
of
the
other
.
Each
message
is
labeled
with
the
message
name
,
which
typically
should
be
the
name
of
a
method
in
the
class
of
the
target
object
.
An
object
can
also
make
a
self
call
,
which
is
shown
as
a
message
starting
and
ending
in
the
same
object
’
s
lifeline
.
To
clarify
the
sequence
of
messages
and
relative
timing
of
each
,
time
is
represented
as
increasing
as
one
moves
farther
away
downwards
from
the
object
name
in
the
object
life
.
That
is
,
time
is
represented
by
the
y-axis
,
increasing
downwards
.
Figure
6.15
:
Sequence
diagram
for
printing
a
graduation
report
.
Using
the
lifeline
of
objects
and
arrows
,
one
can
model
objects
’
lives
and
how
messages
flow
from
one
object
to
another
.
However
,
frequently
a
message
is
sent
from
one
object
to
another
only
under
some
condition
.
This
condition
can
be
represented
in
the
sequence
diagram
by
specifying
it
within
brackets
before
the
message
name
.
If
a
message
is
sent
to
multiple
receiver
objects
,
then
this
multiplicity
is
shown
by
having
a
“
*
”
before
the
message
name
.
Each
message
has
a
return
,
which
is
when
the
operation
finishes
and
returns
the
value
(
if
any
)
to
the
invoking
object
.
Though
often
this
message
can
be
implied
,
sometimes
it
may
be
desirable
to
show
the
return
message
explicitly
.
This
is
done
by
using
a
dashed
arrow
.
An
example
sequence
diagram
is
shown
in
Figure
This
example
concerns
printing
the
graduation
report
for
students
.
The
object
for
GradReport
(
which
has
the
responsibility
for
printing
the
report
)
sends
a
message
to
the
Student
objects
for
the
relevant
information
,
which
request
the
CourseTaken
objects
for
the
courses
the
student
has
taken
.
These
objects
get
information
about
the
courses
from
the
Course
objects
.
A
collaboration
diagram
also
shows
how
objects
communicate
.
Instead
of
using
a
timeline-based
representation
that
is
used
by
sequence
diagrams
,
a
col-
laboration
diagram
looks
more
like
a
state
diagram
.
Each
object
is
represented
in
the
diagram
,
and
the
messages
sent
from
one
object
to
another
are
shown
as
numbered
arrows
from
one
object
to
the
other
.
In
other
words
,
the
chrono-
logical
ordering
of
messages
is
captured
by
message
numbering
,
in
contrast
to
a
sequence
diagram
where
ordering
of
messages
is
shown
pictorially
.
As
should
be
clear
,
the
two
types
of
interaction
diagrams
are
semantically
equivalent
and
have
the
same
representation
power
.
The
collaboration
diagram
for
the
above
example
is
shown
in
Figure
Over
the
years
,
however
,
sequence
diagrams
have
become
more
popular
,
as
people
find
the
visual
representation
of
sequenc-
ing
quicker
to
grasp
.
Figure
6.16
:
Collaboration
diagram
for
printing
a
graduation
report
.
As
we
can
see
,
an
interaction
diagram
models
the
internal
dynamic
behavior
of
the
system
,
when
the
system
performs
some
function
.
The
internal
dynam-
ics
of
the
system
is
represented
in
terms
of
how
the
objects
interact
with
each
other
.
Through
an
interaction
diagram
,
one
can
clearly
see
how
a
system
inter-
nally
implements
an
operation
,
and
what
messages
are
sent
between
different
objects
.
If
a
convincing
interaction
diagram
can
not
be
constructed
for
a
system
operation
with
the
classes
that
have
been
identified
in
the
class
diagram
,
then
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
system
structure
is
not
capable
of
supporting
this
operation
and
that
it
must
be
enhanced
.
So
,
it
can
be
used
to
validate
if
the
system
structure
being
designed
through
class
diagrams
is
capable
of
providing
the
desired
services
.
As
a
system
has
many
functions
,
each
involving
different
objects
in
different
ways
,
there
will
be
a
dynamic
model
for
each
of
these
functions
or
use
cases
.
In
other
words
,
whereas
one
class
diagram
can
capture
the
structure
of
the
system
’
s
code
,
for
the
dynamic
behavior
many
diagrams
are
needed
.
However
,
it
may
not
be
feasible
or
practical
to
draw
the
interaction
diagram
for
each
use
case
scenario
.
Typically
,
during
design
,
an
interaction
diagram
of
some
key
use
cases
or
functions
will
be
drawn
to
make
sure
that
the
classes
that
exist
can
indeed
support
the
desired
use
cases
,
and
to
understand
their
dynamics
.
Other
Diagrams
and
Capabilities
UML
is
an
extensible
and
quite
elaborate
modeling
notation
.
Above
we
have
discussed
notation
related
to
two
of
the
most
common
models
developed
while
modeling
a
system—class
diagrams
and
interaction
diagrams
.
These
two
together
help
model
the
static
structure
of
the
system
as
well
as
the
dynamic
behavior
.
There
are
,
however
,
many
other
aspects
that
might
need
to
be
modeled
for
which
extra
notation
is
required
.
UML
provides
notation
for
many
different
types
of
models
.
In
modeling
and
building
systems
,
as
we
have
seen
,
components
may
also
be
used
.
Components
encapsulate
“
larger
”
elements
,
and
are
semantically
simpler
than
classes
.
Components
often
encapsulate
subsystems
and
provide
clearly
defined
interfaces
through
which
these
components
can
be
used
by
other
com-
ponents
in
the
system
.
While
designing
an
architecture
,
as
we
have
seen
,
com-
ponents
are
very
useful
.
UML
provides
a
notation
for
specifying
a
component
,
and
a
separate
notation
for
specifying
a
subsystem
.
In
a
large
system
,
many
classes
may
be
combined
together
to
form
packages
,
where
a
package
is
a
collec-
tion
of
many
elements
,
possibly
of
different
types
.
UML
also
provides
a
notation
to
specify
packages
.
These
are
shown
in
Figure
As
discussed
in
Chapter
5
,
the
deployment
view
of
the
system
is
distinct
from
the
component
or
module
view
.
In
a
deployment
view
,
the
focus
is
on
what
software
element
uses
which
hardware
,
that
is
,
how
the
system
is
deployed
.
UML
has
notation
for
representing
a
deployment
view
.
The
main
element
is
a
node
,
represented
as
a
named
cube
,
which
represents
a
computing
resource
like
the
CPU
which
physically
exists
.
The
name
of
the
cube
identifies
the
resource
as
well
as
its
type
.
Within
the
cube
for
the
node
the
software
elements
it
deploys
(
which
can
be
components
,
packages
,
classes
,
etc
.
)
are
shown
using
their
respective
notation
.
If
different
nodes
communicate
with
each
other
,
this
is
shown
by
connecting
the
nodes
with
lines
.
The
notation
for
packages
,
deployment
view
,
etc.
,
provides
structural
views
of
the
system
from
different
perspectives
.
UML
also
provides
notation
to
ex-
press
different
types
of
behavior
.
A
state
diagram
is
a
model
in
which
the
entity
being
modeled
is
viewed
as
a
set
of
states
,
with
transitions
between
the
states
taking
place
when
some
event
occurs
.
A
state
is
represented
as
a
rectangle
with
rounded
edges
or
as
ellipses
or
circles
;
transitions
are
represented
by
arrows
con-
necting
two
states
.
Details
can
also
be
attached
to
transitions
.
State
diagrams
are
often
used
to
model
the
behavior
of
objects
of
a
class—the
state
represents
the
different
states
of
the
object
and
transition
captures
the
performing
of
the
different
operations
on
that
object
.
So
,
whereas
interaction
diagrams
capture
how
objects
collaborate
,
a
state
diagram
models
how
an
object
itself
evolves
as
operations
are
performed
on
it
.
This
can
help
clearly
understand
and
specify
the
behavior
of
a
class
.
Activity
Diagram
.
This
is
another
diagram
for
modeling
dynamic
behavior
.
It
aims
to
model
a
system
by
modeling
the
activities
that
take
place
in
it
when
the
system
executes
for
performing
some
function
.
Each
activity
is
represented
as
an
oval
,
with
the
name
of
the
activity
within
it
.
From
the
activity
,
the
system
proceeds
to
other
activities
.
Often
,
which
activity
to
perform
next
depends
on
some
decision
.
This
decision
is
shown
as
a
diamond
leading
to
multiple
activities
(
which
are
the
options
for
this
decision
)
.
Repeated
execution
of
some
activities
can
also
be
shown
.
These
diagrams
are
like
flow-charts
,
but
also
have
notation
to
specify
parallel
execution
of
activities
in
a
system
by
specifying
an
activity
splitting
into
multiple
activities
or
many
activities
joining
(
synchronizing
)
after
their
completion
.
UML
is
an
extensible
notation
allowing
a
modeler
the
flexibility
to
represent
newer
concepts
as
well
.
There
are
many
situations
in
which
a
modeler
needs
some
notation
which
is
similar
to
an
existing
one
but
is
not
exactly
the
same
.
For
example
,
in
some
cases
,
one
may
want
to
specify
if
a
class
is
an
abstract
class
or
an
interface
.
Instead
of
having
special
notation
for
these
concepts
,
UML
has
the
concept
of
a
stereotype
,
through
which
existing
notation
can
be
used
to
model
different
concepts
.
An
existing
notation
,
for
example
of
a
class
,
can
be
used
to
represent
some
other
similar
concept
by
specifying
it
as
a
stereotype
by
giving
the
name
of
the
new
concept
within
<
<
and
>
>
.
We
have
already
seen
an
example
earlier
.
A
metaclass
can
be
specified
in
a
similar
manner
;
and
so
can
a
utility
class
(
one
which
has
some
utility
functions
which
are
directly
used
and
whose
objects
are
not
created
)
.
Tagged
values
can
be
used
to
specify
additional
properties
of
the
elements
to
which
they
are
attached
.
They
can
be
attached
to
any
name
,
and
are
spec-
ified
within
“
”
.
Though
tagged
values
can
be
anything
a
modeler
wants
,
it
is
best
to
limit
its
use
to
a
few
clearly
defined
(
and
pre-agreed
)
properties
like
private
,
abstract
,
query
,
readonly
,
etc
.
Notes
can
also
be
attached
to
the
differ-
ent
elements
in
a
model
.
We
have
earlier
seen
the
use
of
some
tagged
values
in
Figure
Use
case
diagrams
are
also
a
part
of
the
UML
.
We
discussed
use
cases
in
an
earlier
chapter
.
In
a
use
case
diagram
,
each
use
case
is
shown
as
a
node
,
and
the
relationship
between
actors
and
use
cases
is
shown
by
arcs
.
They
are
mostly
used
to
provide
a
high-level
summary
of
use
cases
.
Many
design
and
analysis
methodologies
have
been
proposed
.
As
we
stated
earlier
,
a
methodology
basically
uses
the
concepts
(
of
OO
in
this
case
)
to
pro-
vide
guidelines
for
the
design
activity
.
Though
methodologies
are
useful
,
they
do
not
reduce
the
activity
of
design
to
a
sequence
of
steps
that
can
be
followed
mechanically
.
We
briefly
discuss
one
methodology
here
.
Even
though
it
is
one
of
the
earlier
methodologies
,
its
basic
concepts
are
still
applicable
[
15
]
.
We
assume
that
during
architecture
design
the
system
has
been
divided
into
high-level
subsystems
or
components
.
The
problem
we
address
is
how
to
produce
an
object-oriented
design
for
a
subsystem
.
As
we
discussed
earlier
,
the
OO
design
consists
of
specification
of
all
the
classes
and
objects
that
will
exist
in
the
system
implementation
.
A
complete
OO
design
should
be
such
that
in
the
implementation
phase
,
only
further
details
about
methods
or
attributes
need
to
be
added
.
A
few
low-level
objects
may
be
added
later
,
but
most
of
the
classes
and
objects
and
their
relationships
are
identified
during
design
.
An
approach
for
creating
an
OO
design
consists
of
the
following
sequence
of
steps
:
Develop
the
dynamic
model
and
use
it
to
define
operations
on
classes
.
Develop
the
functional
model
and
use
it
to
define
operations
on
classes
.
Identifying
Classes
and
Relationships
Identifying
the
classes
and
their
re-
lationships
requires
identification
of
object
types
in
the
problem
domain
,
the
structures
between
classes
(
both
inheritance
and
aggregation
)
,
attributes
of
the
different
classes
,
associations
between
the
different
classes
,
and
the
services
each
class
needs
to
provide
to
support
the
system
.
Basically
,
in
this
step
we
are
trying
to
define
the
initial
class
diagram
of
the
design
.
To
identify
analysis
objects
,
start
by
looking
at
the
problem
and
its
descrip-
tion
.
In
the
descriptions
consider
the
phrases
that
represent
entities
.
Include
an
entity
as
an
object
if
the
system
needs
to
remember
something
about
it
,
the
system
needs
some
services
from
it
to
perform
its
own
services
,
or
it
has
mul-
tiple
attributes
.
If
the
system
does
not
need
to
keep
information
about
some
real-world
entity
or
does
not
need
any
services
from
the
entity
,
it
need
not
be
considered
as
an
object
for
design
.
Carefully
consider
objects
that
have
only
one
attribute
;
such
objects
can
frequently
be
included
as
attributes
in
other
objects
.
Though
in
the
analysis
we
focus
on
identifying
objects
,
in
modeling
,
classes
for
these
objects
are
represented
.
Classes
have
attributes
.
Attributes
add
detail
about
the
class
and
are
the
repositories
of
data
for
an
object
.
For
example
,
for
an
object
of
class
Person
,
the
attributes
could
be
the
name
,
sex
,
and
address
.
The
data
stored
in
forms
of
values
of
attributes
are
hidden
from
outside
the
objects
and
are
accessed
and
manipulated
only
by
the
service
functions
for
that
object
.
Which
attributes
should
be
used
to
define
the
class
of
an
object
depends
on
the
problem
and
what
needs
to
be
done
.
For
example
,
while
modeling
a
hospital
system
,
for
the
class
Person
attributes
of
height
,
weight
,
and
date
of
birth
may
be
needed
,
although
these
may
not
be
needed
for
a
database
for
a
county
that
keeps
track
of
populations
in
various
neighborhoods
.
To
identify
attributes
,
consider
each
class
and
see
which
attributes
are
needed
by
the
problem
domain
.
This
is
frequently
a
simple
task
.
Then
posi-
tion
each
attribute
properly
using
the
structures
;
if
the
attribute
is
a
common
attribute
,
it
should
be
placed
in
the
superclass
,
while
if
it
is
specific
to
a
special-
ized
object
,
it
should
be
placed
with
the
subclass
.
While
identifying
attributes
,
new
classes
may
also
get
defined
or
old
classes
may
disappear
(
e.g.
,
if
you
find
that
a
class
really
is
an
attribute
of
another
)
.
For
a
class
diagram
,
we
also
need
to
identify
the
structures
and
associations
between
classes
.
To
identify
the
classification
structure
,
consider
the
classes
that
have
been
identified
as
a
generalization
and
see
if
there
are
other
classes
that
can
be
considered
as
specializations
of
this
.
The
specializations
should
be
meaningful
for
the
problem
domain
.
For
example
,
if
the
problem
domain
does
not
care
about
the
material
used
to
make
some
objects
,
there
is
no
point
in
specializing
the
classes
based
on
the
material
they
are
made
of
.
Similarly
,
consider
classes
as
specializations
and
see
if
there
are
other
classes
that
have
similar
attributes
.
If
so
,
see
if
a
generalized
class
can
be
identified
of
which
these
are
specializations
.
Once
again
,
the
structure
obtained
must
naturally
reflect
the
hierarchy
in
the
problem
domain
;
it
should
not
be
“
extracted
”
simply
because
some
classes
have
some
attributes
with
the
same
names
.
To
identify
assembly
structure
,
a
similar
approach
is
taken
.
Consider
each
object
of
a
class
as
an
assembly
and
identify
its
parts
.
See
if
the
system
needs
to
keep
track
of
the
parts
.
If
it
does
,
then
the
parts
must
be
reflected
as
objects
;
if
not
,
then
the
parts
should
not
be
modeled
as
separate
objects
.
Then
,
consider
an
object
of
a
class
as
a
part
and
see
to
which
class
’
s
object
it
can
be
considered
as
belonging
.
Once
again
,
this
separation
is
maintained
only
if
the
system
needs
it
.
As
before
,
the
structures
identified
should
naturally
reflect
the
hierarchy
in
the
problem
domain
and
should
not
be
“
forced
.
”
For
associations
we
need
to
identify
the
relationship
between
instances
of
various
classes
.
For
example
,
an
instance
of
the
class
Company
may
be
related
to
an
instance
of
the
class
Person
by
an
“
employs
”
relationship
.
This
is
similar
to
what
is
done
in
ER
modeling
.
And
like
in
ER
modeling
,
an
instance
connec-
tion
may
be
of
1
:
.
Or
it
could
be
1
:
M
,
indicating
that
one
instance
of
this
class
may
be
related
to
many
instances
of
the
other
class
.
There
are
M
:
M
connections
,
and
there
are
sometimes
multiway
connections
,
but
these
are
not
very
common
.
The
associations
between
objects
are
derived
from
the
problem
domain
directly
once
the
objects
have
been
identified
.
An
association
may
have
attributes
of
its
own
;
these
are
typically
attributes
that
do
not
naturally
belong
to
either
object
.
Although
in
many
situations
they
can
be
“
forced
”
to
belong
to
one
of
the
two
objects
without
losing
any
information
,
it
should
not
be
done
unless
the
attribute
naturally
belongs
to
the
object
.
Dynamic
Modeling
The
class
diagram
obtained
gives
the
initial
module-level
design
.
This
design
will
be
further
shaped
by
the
events
in
the
system
,
as
the
design
has
to
ensure
that
the
expected
behavior
for
the
events
can
be
supported
.
Modeling
the
dynamic
behavior
of
the
system
will
help
in
further
refining
the
design
.
The
dynamic
model
of
a
system
aims
to
specify
how
the
state
of
various
objects
changes
when
events
occur
.
An
event
is
something
that
happens
at
some
time
instance
.
For
an
object
,
an
event
is
essentially
a
request
for
an
operation
.
An
event
typically
is
an
occurrence
of
something
and
has
no
time
duration
associated
with
it
.
Each
event
has
an
initiator
and
a
responder
.
Events
can
be
internal
to
the
system
,
in
which
case
the
event
initiator
and
the
event
responder
are
both
within
the
system
.
An
event
can
be
an
external
event
,
in
which
case
the
event
initiator
is
outside
the
system
(
e.g.
,
the
user
or
a
sensor
)
.
A
scenario
is
a
sequence
of
events
that
occur
in
a
particular
execution
of
the
system
,
as
we
have
seen
while
discussing
use
cases
in
Chapter
3
.
From
the
scenarios
,
the
different
events
being
performed
on
different
objects
can
be
identified
,
which
are
then
used
to
identify
services
on
objects
.
The
different
scenarios
together
can
completely
characterize
the
behavior
of
the
system
.
If
the
design
is
such
that
it
can
support
all
the
scenarios
,
we
can
be
sure
that
the
desired
dynamic
behavior
of
the
system
can
be
supported
by
the
design
.
This
is
the
basic
reason
for
performing
dynamic
modeling
.
With
use
cases
,
dynamic
modeling
involves
preparing
interaction
diagrams
for
the
important
scenarios
.
It
is
best
to
start
by
modeling
scenarios
being
triggered
by
external
events
.
The
scenarios
should
not
necessarily
cover
all
possibilities
,
but
the
major
ones
should
be
considered
.
First
the
main
success
scenarios
should
be
modeled
,
then
scenarios
for
“
exceptional
”
cases
should
be
modeled
.
For
example
,
in
a
restau-
rant
,
the
main
success
scenario
for
placing
an
order
could
be
the
following
sequence
of
actions
:
customer
reads
the
menu
;
customer
places
the
order
;
order
is
sent
to
the
kitchen
for
preparation
;
ordered
items
are
served
;
customer
re-
quests
a
bill
for
the
order
;
bill
is
prepared
for
this
order
;
customer
is
given
the
bill
;
customer
pays
the
bill
.
An
“
exception
”
scenario
could
be
if
the
ordered
item
was
not
available
or
if
the
customer
cancels
his
order
.
From
each
scenario
,
events
have
to
be
identified
.
Events
are
interactions
with
the
outside
world
and
object-to-object
interactions
.
All
the
events
that
have
the
same
effect
on
the
flow
of
control
in
the
system
are
grouped
as
a
single
event
type
.
Each
event
type
is
then
allocated
to
the
object
classes
that
initiate
it
and
that
service
the
event
.
With
this
done
,
a
scenario
can
be
represented
as
a
sequence
(
or
collaboration
)
diagram
showing
the
events
that
will
take
place
on
the
different
objects
in
the
execution
corresponding
to
the
scenario
.
A
possible
sequence
diagram
of
the
main
success
scenario
of
the
restaurant
is
given
in
Figure
Figure
6.18
:
A
sequence
diagram
for
the
restaurant
.
Once
the
main
scenarios
are
modeled
,
various
events
on
objects
that
are
needed
to
support
executions
corresponding
to
the
various
scenarios
are
known
.
This
information
is
then
used
to
expand
our
view
of
the
classes
in
the
design
.
Generally
speaking
,
for
each
event
in
the
sequence
diagrams
,
there
will
be
an
operation
on
the
object
on
which
the
event
is
invoked
.
So
,
by
using
the
scenarios
and
sequence
diagrams
we
can
further
refine
our
view
of
the
objects
and
add
operations
that
are
needed
to
support
some
scenarios
but
may
not
have
been
identified
during
initial
modeling
.
For
example
,
from
the
event
trace
diagram
in
Figure
we
can
see
that
“
place
order
”
and
“
getBill
”
will
be
two
operations
required
on
the
object
of
type
Order
if
this
interaction
is
to
be
supported
.
The
effect
of
these
different
events
on
a
class
itself
can
be
modeled
using
the
state
diagrams
.
We
believe
that
the
state
transition
diagram
is
of
limited
use
during
system
design
but
may
be
more
useful
during
detailed
design
.
Hence
,
we
will
discuss
state
modeling
of
classes
later
.
Functional
Modeling
A
functional
model
of
a
system
specifies
how
the
output
values
are
computed
in
the
system
from
the
input
values
,
without
considering
the
control
aspects
of
the
computation
.
This
represents
the
functional
view
of
the
system—the
mapping
from
inputs
to
outputs
and
the
various
steps
involved
in
the
mapping
.
Generally
,
when
the
transformation
from
the
inputs
to
outputs
is
complex
,
consisting
of
many
steps
,
the
functional
modeling
is
likely
to
be
useful
.
In
systems
where
the
transformation
of
inputs
to
outputs
is
not
complex
,
functional
model
is
likely
to
be
straightforward
.
As
we
have
seen
,
the
functional
model
of
a
system
can
be
represented
by
a
data
flow
diagram
(
DFD
)
.
We
have
used
DFDs
in
problem
modeling
,
and
the
structured
design
methodology
,
discussed
earlier
.
Just
as
with
dynamic
modeling
,
the
basic
purpose
of
doing
functional
modeling
is
to
use
the
model
to
make
sure
that
the
object
model
can
perform
the
transformations
required
from
the
system
.
As
processes
represent
operations
and
in
an
object-oriented
system
,
most
of
the
processing
is
done
by
operations
on
classes
,
all
processes
should
show
up
as
operations
on
classes
.
Some
operations
might
appear
as
single
operations
on
an
object
;
others
might
appear
as
multiple
operations
on
different
classes
,
depending
on
the
level
of
abstraction
of
the
DFD
.
If
the
DFD
is
sufficiently
detailed
,
most
processes
will
occur
as
operations
on
classes
.
The
DFD
also
specifies
the
abstract
signature
of
the
operations
by
identifying
the
inputs
and
outputs
.
Defining
Internal
Classes
and
Operations
The
classes
identified
so
far
are
the
ones
that
come
from
the
problem
domain
.
The
methods
identified
on
the
objects
are
the
ones
needed
to
satisfy
all
the
interactions
with
the
environment
and
the
user
and
to
support
the
desired
functionality
.
However
,
the
final
design
is
a
blueprint
for
implementation
.
Hence
,
implementation
issues
have
to
be
con-
sidered
.
While
considering
implementation
issues
,
algorithm
and
optimization
issues
arise
.
These
issues
are
handled
in
this
step
.
First
,
each
class
is
critically
evaluated
to
see
if
it
is
needed
in
its
present
form
in
the
final
implementation
.
Some
of
the
classes
might
be
discarded
if
the
designer
feels
they
are
not
needed
during
implementation
.
Then
the
implementation
of
operations
on
the
classes
is
considered
.
For
this
,
rough
algorithms
for
implementation
might
be
considered
.
While
doing
this
,
a
complex
operation
may
get
defined
in
terms
of
lower-level
operations
on
simpler
classes
.
In
other
words
,
effective
implementation
of
operations
may
require
heavy
interaction
with
some
data
structures
and
the
data
structure
to
be
considered
an
object
in
its
own
right
.
These
classes
that
are
identified
while
considering
implementation
concerns
are
largely
support
classes
that
may
be
needed
to
store
intermediate
results
or
to
model
some
aspects
of
the
object
whose
operation
is
to
be
implemented
.
Once
the
implementation
of
each
class
and
each
operation
on
the
class
has
been
considered
and
it
has
been
satisfied
that
they
can
be
implemented
,
the
system
design
is
complete
.
The
detailed
design
might
also
uncover
some
very
low-level
objects
,
but
most
such
objects
should
be
identified
during
system
Optimize
and
Package
During
design
,
some
inefficiencies
may
have
crept
in
.
In
this
final
step
,
the
issue
of
efficiency
is
considered
,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
final
structures
should
not
deviate
too
much
from
the
logical
structure
produced
.
Various
optimizations
are
possible
and
a
designer
can
exercise
his
judgment
keeping
in
mind
the
modularity
aspects
also
.
Before
we
apply
the
methodology
on
some
examples
,
it
should
be
remembered
again
that
no
design
methodology
reduces
the
activity
of
producing
a
design
to
a
series
of
steps
that
can
be
mechanically
executed
;
each
step
requires
some
amount
of
engineering
judgment
.
Methodologies
are
essentially
guidelines
to
help
the
designer
in
the
design
activity
;
they
are
not
hard-and-fast
rules
.
The
examples
we
present
here
are
relatively
small
,
and
all
aspects
of
the
methodol-
ogy
do
not
get
reflected
in
them
.
The
Word
Counting
Problem
Let
us
first
consider
the
word
counting
problem
discussed
earlier
as
an
example
for
Structured
Design
methodology
.
The
initial
analysis
clearly
shows
that
there
is
a
File
object
,
which
is
an
aggregation
of
many
Word
objects
.
Further
,
one
can
consider
that
there
is
a
Counter
object
,
which
keeps
track
of
the
number
of
different
words
.
It
is
a
matter
of
preference
and
opinion
whether
Counter
should
be
an
object
,
or
counting
should
be
im-
plemented
as
an
operation
.
If
counting
is
treated
as
an
operation
,
the
question
will
be
to
which
object
it
belongs
.
As
it
does
not
belong
“
naturally
”
to
either
the
class
Word
or
the
class
File
,
it
will
have
to
be
“
forced
”
into
one
of
the
classes
.
For
this
reason
,
we
have
kept
Counter
as
a
separate
object
.
The
basic
problem
statement
finds
only
these
three
objects
.
However
,
further
analysis
for
services
reveals
that
some
history
mechanism
is
needed
to
check
if
the
word
is
unique
.
The
class
diagram
obtained
after
doing
the
initial
modeling
is
shown
in
Figure
Now
let
us
consider
the
dynamic
modeling
for
this
problem
.
This
is
essen-
tially
a
batch
processing
problem
,
where
a
file
is
given
as
input
and
some
output
is
given
by
the
system
.
Hence
,
the
use
case
and
scenario
for
this
problem
are
straightforward
.
For
example
,
the
scenario
for
the
“
normal
”
case
can
be
:
System
prompts
for
the
file
name
;
user
enters
the
file
name
.
Figure
6.19
:
Class
diagram
for
the
word
counting
problem
.
From
this
simple
scenario
,
no
new
operations
are
uncovered
,
and
our
class
diagram
stays
unchanged
.
Now
we
consider
the
functional
model
.
One
possible
functional
model
is
shown
in
Figure
The
model
reinforces
the
need
for
some
object
where
the
history
of
what
words
have
been
seen
is
recorded
.
This
object
is
used
to
check
the
uniqueness
of
the
words
.
It
also
shows
that
various
operations
like
increment
(
)
,
isunique
(
)
,
and
addToHistory
(
)
are
needed
.
These
operations
should
appear
as
operations
in
classes
or
should
be
supported
by
a
combination
of
operations
.
In
this
example
,
most
of
these
processes
are
reflected
as
operations
on
classes
and
are
already
incorporated
in
the
design
.
Now
we
are
at
the
last
two
steps
of
design
methodology
,
where
implemen-
tation
and
optimization
concerns
are
used
to
enhance
the
object
model
.
First
decision
we
take
is
that
the
history
mechanism
will
be
implemented
by
a
bi-
nary
search
tree
.
Hence
,
instead
of
the
class
History
,
we
have
a
different
class
Btree
.
Then
,
for
the
class
Word
,
various
operations
are
needed
to
compare
dif-
ferent
words
.
Operations
are
also
needed
to
set
the
string
value
for
a
word
and
retrieve
it
.
The
final
class
diagram
is
similar
in
structure
to
the
one
shown
in
Figure
except
for
these
changes
.
The
final
step
of
the
design
activity
is
to
specify
this
design
.
This
is
not
a
part
of
the
design
methodology
,
but
it
is
an
essential
step
,
as
the
design
specification
is
what
forms
the
major
part
of
the
design
document
.
The
design
specification
,
as
mentioned
earlier
,
should
specify
all
the
classes
that
are
in
the
design
,
all
methods
of
the
classes
along
with
their
interfaces
.

As
we

,
all
the
class
definitions
complete
with
data
members
and
operations
and
all
the
major
declarations
are

in
the
design

Only
the

of

This

.
The
conversion
to
code
required
only
minor
additions
and
modifications
to
the

The
final

.
Rate
of
Returns
Problem
Let
us
consider
a
slightly
larger
problem
:
of
deter-
mining
the
rate
of
returns
on
investments
.
An
investor
has
made
investments
in
some
companies
.
For
each
investment
,
in
a
file
,
the
name
of
the
company
,
all
the
money
he
has
invested
(
in
the
initial
purchase
as
well
as
in
subsequent
purchases
)
,
and
all
the
money
he
has
withdrawn
(
through
sale
of
shares
or
div-
idends
)
are
given
,
along
with
the
dates
of
each
transaction
.
The
current
value
of
the
investment
is
given
at
the
end
,
along
with
the
date
.
The
goal
is
to
find
the
rate
of
return
the
investor
is
getting
for
each
investment
,
as
well
as
the
rate
of
return
for
the
entire
portfolio
.
In
addition
,
the
amounts
he
has
invested
initially
,
amounts
he
has
invested
subsequently
,
amounts
he
has
withdrawn
,
and
the
current
value
of
the
portfolio
also
is
to
be
output
.
This
is
a
practical
problem
that
is
frequently
needed
by
investors
,
and
a
rate
of
returns
calculator
can
easily
form
an
important
component
of
a
larger
financial
management
system
.
The
computation
of
rate
of
return
is
not
straight-
forward
and
can
not
be
easily
done
through
spreadsheets
.
Hence
,
such
a
software
can
be
of
practical
use
.
Initial
problem
analysis
easily
throws
up
a
few
object
classes
of
interest—
Portfolio
,
Investment
,
and
Transaction
.
A
portfolio
consists
of
many
in-
vestments
,
and
an
investment
consists
of
many
transactions
.
Hence
,
the
class
Portfolio
is
an
aggregation
of
many
Investments
,
and
an
Investment
is
an
aggregation
of
many
Transactions
.
A
transaction
can
be
of
Withdrawal
type
or
Deposit
type
,
resulting
in
a
class
hierarchy
,
with
Investment
being
the
superclass
and
Withdrawal
and
Deposit
subclasses
.
For
an
object
of
class
Investment
,
the
major
operation
we
need
to
perform
is
to
find
the
rate
of
return
.
For
the
class
Portfolio
we
need
to
have
operations
to
compute
rate
of
return
,
total
initial
investment
,
total
withdrawal
,
and
total
current
value
of
the
portfolio
.
Hence
,
we
need
operations
for
these
.
The
class
diagram
obtained
from
analysis
of
the
problem
is
shown
in
Figure
Figure
6.21
:
Class
diagram
for
rate
of
return
problem
.
In
this
problem
,
as
the
interaction
with
the
environment
is
not
much
,
the
dynamic
model
is
not
significant
.
Hence
,
we
omit
the
dynamic
modeling
for
this
problem
.
A
possible
functional
model
is
given
in
Figure
The
classes
are
then
enhanced
to
make
sure
that
each
of
the
processes
of
the
functional
model
is
reflected
as
operations
on
various
objects
.
As
we
can
see
,
most
of
the
processes
already
exist
as
operations
.
Now
we
have
to
perform
the
last
two
steps
of
the
design
methodology
,
where
implementation
and
optimization
concerns
are
used
to
enhance
the
classes
.
While
considering
the
implementation
of
computation
of
total
initial
invest-
ment
,
computation
of
overall
return
rate
,
overall
withdrawals
,
and
so
on
,
we
notice
that
for
all
of
these
,
appropriate
data
from
each
investment
is
needed
.
Figure
6.22
:
Functional
model
for
the
rate
of
return
problem
.
Hence
,
to
the
class
Investments
,
appropriate
operations
need
to
be
added
.
Further
,
we
note
that
all
the
computations
for
total
initial
investment
,
total
current
value
,
and
so
on
are
all
done
together
,
and
each
of
these
is
essentially
adding
values
from
various
investments
.
Hence
,
we
combine
them
in
a
single
operation
in
Portfolio
and
a
corresponding
single
operation
in
Investment
.
Studying
the
class
hierarchy
,
we
observe
that
the
only
difference
in
the
two
sub-
classes
Withdrawal
and
Deposit
is
that
in
one
case
the
amount
is
subtracted
and
in
the
other
it
is
added
.
In
such
a
situation
,
the
two
types
can
be
easily
considered
a
single
type
by
keeping
the
amount
as
negative
for
a
withdrawal
and
positive
for
a
deposit
.
So
we
remove
the
subclasses
,
thereby
simplifying
the
design
and
implementation
.
Instead
of
giving
the
class
diagram
for
the
final
design
,
we
provide
the
specification
of
the
classes
:

//

etc
.
The
design
is
self-explanatory
.
This
design
was
later
implemented
in
C++
code
,
and
we
found
that
only
minor
implementation
details
got
added
during
the
implementation
,
showing
the
correctness
and
completeness
of
the
design
.
The
final
size
of
the
program
was
about
470
lines
of
C++
code
(
counting
noncomment
and
nonblank
lines
only
)
.
In
the
previous
two
sections
we
discussed
two
different
approaches
for
system
design—one
based
on
functional
abstraction
and
one
based
on
objects
.
In
sys-
tem
design
we
concentrate
on
the
modules
in
a
system
and
how
they
interact
with
each
other
.
Once
the
modules
are
identified
and
specified
during
the
high-
level
design
,
the
internal
logic
that
will
implement
the
given
specifications
can
be
designed
,
and
is
the
focus
of
this
section
.
The
detailed
design
activity
is
often
not
performed
formally
and
archived
as
it
is
almost
impossible
to
keep
the
detailed
design
document
consistent
with
the
code
.
Due
to
this
,
developing
the
detailed
design
is
useful
for
the
more
complex
and
important
modules
,
and
is
often
done
informally
by
the
programmer
as
part
of
the
personal
process
of
developing
code
.
The
basic
goal
in
detailed
design
is
to
specify
the
logic
for
the
different
modules
that
have
been
specified
during
system
design
.
Specifying
the
logic
will
require
developing
an
algorithm
that
will
implement
the
given
specifications
.
Here
we
consider
some
principles
for
designing
algorithms
or
logic
that
will
implement
the
given
specifications
.
The
term
algorithm
is
quite
general
and
is
applicable
to
a
wide
variety
of
areas
.
For
software
we
can
consider
an
algorithm
to
be
an
unambiguous
proce-
dure
for
solving
a
problem
[
42
]
.
A
procedure
is
a
finite
sequence
of
well-defined
steps
or
operations
,
each
of
which
requires
a
finite
amount
of
memory
and
time
to
complete
.
In
this
definition
we
assume
that
termination
is
an
essential
prop-
erty
of
procedures
.
From
now
on
we
will
use
procedures
,
algorithms
,
and
logic
interchangeably
.
There
are
a
number
of
steps
that
one
has
to
perform
while
developing
an
algorithm
[
42
]
.
The
starting
step
in
the
design
of
algorithms
is
statement
of
the
problem
.
The
problem
for
which
an
algorithm
is
being
devised
has
to
be
precisely
and
clearly
stated
and
properly
understood
by
the
person
responsible
for
designing
the
algorithm
.
For
detailed
design
,
the
problem
statement
comes
from
the
system
design
.
That
is
,
the
problem
statement
is
already
available
when
the
detailed
design
of
a
module
commences
.
The
next
step
is
develop-
ment
of
a
mathematical
model
for
the
problem
.
In
modeling
,
one
has
to
select
the
mathematical
structures
that
are
best
suited
for
the
problem
.
It
can
help
to
look
at
other
similar
problems
that
have
been
solved
.
In
most
cases
,
models
are
constructed
by
taking
models
of
similar
problems
and
modifying
the
model
to
suit
the
current
problem
.
The
next
step
is
the
design
of
the
algorithm
.
Dur-
ing
this
step
the
data
structure
and
program
structure
are
decided
.
Once
the
algorithm
is
designed
,
its
correctness
should
be
verified
.
No
clear
procedure
can
be
given
for
designing
algorithms
.
Having
such
a
pro-
cedure
amounts
to
automating
the
problem
of
algorithm
development
,
which
is
not
possible
with
the
current
methods
.
However
,
some
heuristics
or
methods
can
be
provided
to
help
the
designer
design
algorithms
for
modules
.
The
most
common
method
for
designing
algorithms
or
the
logic
for
a
module
is
to
use
the
stepwise
refinement
technique
[
84
]
.
The
stepwise
refinement
technique
breaks
the
logic
design
problem
into
a
series
of
steps
,
so
that
the
development
can
be
done
gradually
.
The
process
starts
by
converting
the
specifications
of
the
module
into
an
abstract
descrip-
tion
of
an
algorithm
containing
a
few
abstract
statements
.
In
each
step
,
one
or
several
statements
in
the
algorithm
developed
so
far
are
decomposed
into
more
detailed
instructions
.
The
successive
refinement
terminates
when
all
in-
structions
are
sufficiently
precise
that
they
can
easily
be
converted
into
pro-
gramming
language
statements
.
During
refinement
,
both
data
and
instructions
have
to
be
refined
.
A
guideline
for
refinement
is
that
in
each
step
the
amount
of
decomposition
should
be
such
that
it
can
be
easily
handled
and
that
rep-
resents
one
or
two
design
decisions
.
Generally
,
detailed
design
is
not
specified
using
formal
programming
languages
,
but
using
languages
that
have
formal
programming
language
like
outer
structures
(
like
loops
,
conditionals
,
etc
.
)
,
but
a
freer
format
for
internal
description
.
This
allows
the
designer
to
focus
on
the
logic
and
not
its
representation
in
the
programming
language
.
For
object-oriented
design
,
the
approach
just
discussed
for
obtaining
the
de-
tailed
design
can
be
used
for
designing
the
logic
of
methods
.
But
a
class
is
not
a
functional
abstraction
and
can
not
be
viewed
as
merely
a
collection
of
functions
(
methods
)
.
The
technique
for
getting
a
more
detailed
understanding
of
the
class
as
a
whole
,
without
talking
about
the
logic
of
different
methods
,
has
to
be
different
from
the
refinement-based
approach
.
An
object
of
a
class
has
some
state
and
many
operations
on
it
.
To
better
understand
a
class
,
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
various
operations
and
the
effect
of
interaction
of
various
opera-
tions
have
to
be
understood
.
This
can
be
viewed
as
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
detailed
design
activity
for
object-oriented
development
.
Once
the
overall
class
is
better
understood
,
the
algorithms
for
its
various
methods
can
be
developed
.
A
method
to
understand
the
behavior
of
a
class
is
to
view
it
as
a
finite
state
automaton
,
which
consists
of
states
and
transitions
between
states
.
When
modeling
an
object
,
the
state
is
the
value
of
its
attributes
,
and
an
event
is
the
performing
of
an
operation
on
the
object
.
A
state
diagram
relates
events
and
states
by
showing
how
the
state
changes
when
an
event
is
performed
.
A
state
diagram
for
an
object
will
generally
have
an
initial
state
,
from
which
all
states
are
reachable
(
i.e.
,
there
is
a
path
from
the
initial
state
to
all
other
states
)
.
A
state
diagram
for
an
object
does
not
represent
all
the
actual
states
of
the
object
,
as
there
are
many
possible
states
.
A
state
diagram
attempts
to
represent
only
the
logical
states
of
the
object
.
A
logical
state
of
an
object
is
a
combination
of
all
those
states
from
which
the
behavior
of
the
object
is
similar
for
all
possible
events
.
Two
logical
states
will
have
different
behavior
for
at
least
one
event
.
For
example
,
for
an
object
that
represents
a
stack
,
all
states
that
represent
a
stack
of
size
more
than
0
and
less
than
some
defined
maximum
are
similar
as
the
behavior
of
all
operations
defined
on
the
stack
will
be
similar
in
all
such
states
(
e.g.
,
push
will
add
an
element
,
pop
will
remove
one
,
etc.
)
.
However
,
the
state
representing
an
empty
stack
is
different
as
the
behavior
of
top
and
pop
operations
are
different
now
(
an
error
message
may
be
returned
)
.
Similarly
,
the
state
representing
a
full
stack
is
different
.
The
state
model
for
this
bounded
size
stack
is
shown
in
Figure
The
finite
state
modeling
of
objects
is
an
aid
to
understand
the
effect
of
various
operations
defined
on
the
class
on
the
state
of
the
object
.
A
good
un-
derstanding
of
this
can
aid
in
developing
the
logic
for
each
of
the
operations
.
To
develop
the
logic
of
operations
,
regular
approaches
for
algorithm
development
can
be
used
.
The
model
can
also
be
used
to
validate
if
the
logic
for
an
operation
is
correct
.
As
we
will
see
later
,
a
state
model
can
be
used
for
generating
test
cases
for
validation
.
The
output
of
the
design
activity
should
be
verified
before
proceeding
with
the
activities
of
the
next
phase
.
If
the
design
is
expressed
in
some
formal
notation
for
which
analysis
tools
are
available
,
then
through
tools
it
can
be
checked
for
internal
consistency
(
e.g.
,
those
modules
used
by
another
are
defined
,
the
interface
of
a
module
is
consistent
with
the
way
others
use
it
,
data
usage
is
consistent
with
declaration
,
etc
.
)
If
the
design
is
not
specified
in
a
formal
,
executable
language
,
it
can
not
be
processed
through
tools
,
and
other
means
for
verification
have
to
be
used
.
The
most
common
approach
for
verification
is
The
purpose
of
design
reviews
is
to
ensure
that
the
design
satisfies
the
re-
quirements
and
is
of
good
quality
.
If
errors
are
made
during
the
design
process
,
they
will
ultimately
reflect
themselves
in
the
code
and
the
final
system
.
As
the
cost
of
removing
faults
caused
by
errors
that
occur
during
design
increases
with
the
delay
in
detecting
the
errors
,
it
is
best
if
design
errors
are
detected
early
,
before
they
manifest
themselves
in
the
system
.
Detecting
errors
in
design
is
the
purpose
of
design
reviews
.
The
system
design
review
process
is
similar
to
the
inspection
process
,
in
that
a
group
of
people
get
together
to
discuss
the
design
with
the
aim
of
revealing
design
errors
or
undesirable
properties
.
The
review
group
must
include
a
member
of
both
the
system
design
team
and
the
detailed
design
team
,
the
author
of
the
requirements
document
,
the
author
responsible
for
maintaining
the
design
document
,
and
an
independent
software
quality
engineer
.
As
with
any
review
,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
aim
of
the
meeting
is
to
uncover
design
errors
,
not
to
try
to
fix
them
;
fixing
is
done
later
.
The
number
of
ways
in
which
errors
can
enter
a
design
is
limited
only
by
the
creativity
of
the
designer
.
The
most
important
design
error
,
however
,
is
that
the
design
does
not
fully
support
some
requirements
.
For
example
,
some
exception
case
scenario
can
not
be
handled
,
or
some
design
constraint
has
not
been
satisfied
.
For
design
quality
,
modularity
is
the
main
criterion
.
However
,
since
there
is
a
need
to
validate
whether
performance
requirements
can
be
met
by
a
design
,
efficiency
is
another
key
property
for
which
a
design
is
evaluated
.
Here
we
discuss
some
of
the
metrics
that
can
be
extracted
from
a
design
and
that
could
be
useful
for
evaluating
the
design
.
We
do
not
discuss
the
standard
metrics
of
effort
or
defect
that
are
collected
(
as
per
the
project
plan
)
for
project
monitoring
.
Size
is
always
a
product
metric
of
interest
.
For
size
of
a
design
,
the
total
number
of
modules
is
a
commonly
used
metric
.
(
By
using
an
average
size
of
a
module
,
from
this
metric
the
final
size
in
LOC
can
be
estimated
and
compared
with
project
estimates
.
)
Another
metric
of
interest
is
complexity
.
A
possible
use
of
complexity
met-
rics
at
design
time
is
to
improve
the
design
by
reducing
the
complexity
of
the
modules
that
have
been
found
to
be
most
complex
.
This
will
directly
improve
the
testability
and
maintainability
.
We
describe
some
of
the
metrics
that
have
been
proposed
to
quantify
the
complexity
of
design
.
We
first
discuss
metrics
for
function-oriented
design
and
then
for
OO
design
.
Network
Metrics
Network
metrics
is
a
complexity
metric
that
tries
to
capture
how
“
good
”
the
structure
chart
is
.
As
coupling
of
a
module
increases
if
it
is
called
by
more
modules
,
a
good
structure
is
considered
one
that
has
exactly
one
caller
.
That
is
,
the
call
graph
structure
is
simplest
if
it
is
a
pure
tree
.
The
more
the
structure
chart
deviates
from
a
tree
,
the
more
complex
the
system
.
Deviation
of
the
tree
is
then
defined
as
the
graph
impurity
of
the
design
[
87
]
.
Graph
impurity
can
be
defined
as
where
n
is
the
number
of
nodes
in
the
structure
chart
and
e
is
the
number
of
edges
.
As
in
a
pure
tree
the
total
number
of
nodes
is
one
more
than
the
number
of
edges
,
the
graph
impurity
for
a
tree
is
0
.
Each
time
a
module
has
a
fan-in
of
more
than
one
,
the
graph
impurity
increases
.
The
major
drawback
of
this
approach
is
that
it
ignores
the
common
use
of
some
routines
like
library
or
support
routines
.
An
approach
to
handle
this
is
not
to
consider
the
lowest-level
nodes
for
graph
impurity
because
most
often
the
lowest-level
modules
are
the
ones
that
are
used
by
many
different
modules
,
particularly
if
the
structure
chart
was
factored
.
Library
routines
are
also
at
the
lowest
level
of
the
structure
chart
(
even
if
they
have
a
structure
of
their
own
,
it
does
not
show
in
the
structure
chart
of
the
application
using
the
routine
)
.
Other
network
metrics
have
also
been
defined
.
For
most
of
these
metrics
,
significant
correlations
with
properties
of
interest
have
not
been
established
.
Hence
,
their
use
is
limited
to
getting
some
idea
about
the
structure
of
the
design
.
Information
Flow
Metrics
The
network
metrics
of
graph
impurity
had
the
basis
that
as
the
graph
impurity
increases
,
the
coupling
increases
.
However
,
it
is
not
a
very
good
approximation
for
coupling
,
as
coupling
of
a
module
increases
with
the
complexity
of
the
interface
and
the
total
number
of
modules
a
module
is
coupled
with
,
whether
it
is
the
caller
or
the
callee
.
So
,
if
we
want
a
metric
that
is
better
at
quantifying
coupling
between
modules
,
it
should
handle
these
.
The
information
flow
metrics
attempt
to
define
the
complexity
in
terms
of
the
total
information
flowing
through
a
module
.
In
one
of
the
earliest
works
on
information
flow
metrics
[
48
,
49
]
,
the
com-
plexity
of
a
module
is
considered
as
depending
on
the
intramodule
complexity
and
the
intermodule
complexity
.
The
intramodule
complexity
is
approximated
by
the
size
of
the
module
in
lines
of
code
.
The
intermodule
complexity
of
a
module
depends
on
the
total
information
flowing
in
the
module
(
inflow
)
and
the
total
information
flowing
out
of
the
module
(
outflow
)
.
The
inflow
of
a
mod-
ule
is
the
total
number
of
abstract
data
elements
flowing
in
the
module
(
i.e.
,
whose
values
are
used
by
the
module
)
,
and
the
outflow
is
the
total
number
of
abstract
data
elements
that
are
flowing
out
of
the
module
(
i.e.
,
whose
values
are
defined
by
this
module
and
used
by
other
modules
)
.
The
module
design
complexity
,
Dc
,
is
defined
as
The
term
(
inflow
outflow
)
refers
to
the
total
number
of
combinations
of
input
source
and
output
destination
.
This
term
is
squared
,
as
the
interconnection
between
the
modules
is
considered
a
more
important
factor
(
compared
to
the
internal
complexity
)
determining
the
complexity
of
a
module
.
This
is
based
on
the
common
experience
that
the
modules
with
more
interconnections
are
harder
to
test
or
modify
compared
to
other
similar-size
modules
with
fewer
interconnections
.
The
metric
defined
earlier
defines
the
complexity
of
a
module
purely
in
terms
of
the
total
amount
of
data
flowing
in
and
out
of
the
module
and
the
module
size
.
A
variant
of
this
was
proposed
based
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
module
complexity
depends
not
only
on
the
information
flowing
in
and
out
,
but
also
on
the
number
of
modules
to
or
from
which
it
is
flowing
.
The
module
size
is
considered
an
insignificant
factor
,
and
complexity
Dc
for
a
module
is
defined
as
[
89
]
where
fan
in
represents
the
number
of
modules
that
call
this
module
and
fan
out
is
the
number
of
modules
this
module
calls
.
How
can
this
metric
be
used
in
design
?
One
method
for
highlighting
the
modules
was
suggested
in
[
89
]
.
Let
avg
complexity
be
the
average
complexity
of
the
modules
in
the
design
being
evaluated
,
and
let
std
deviation
be
the
standard
deviation
in
the
design
complexity
of
the
modules
of
the
system
.
The
proposed
method
classifies
the
modules
in
three
categories
:
error-prone
,
complex
,
and
normal
.
If
Dc
is
the
complexity
of
a
module
,
it
can
be
classified
as
follows
:
Note
that
this
definition
of
error-prone
and
complex
is
independent
of
the
met-
ric
definition
used
to
compute
the
complexity
of
modules
.
With
this
approach
,
a
design
can
be
evaluated
by
itself
,
not
for
overall
design
quality
,
but
to
draw
at-
tention
to
the
error-prone
and
complex
modules
.
This
information
can
then
be
used
to
redesign
the
system
to
reduce
the
complexity
of
these
modules
(
which
also
results
in
overall
complexity
reduction
)
.
This
approach
has
been
found
to
be
very
effective
in
identifying
error-prone
modules
[
89
]
.
A
few
attempts
have
been
made
to
propose
metrics
for
object-oriented
software
[
1
,
21
,
64
]
.
Here
we
present
some
metrics
that
have
been
proposed
for
evaluating
the
complexity
of
an
OOD
.
As
design
of
classes
is
the
central
issue
in
OOD
and
the
major
output
of
any
OOD
methodology
is
the
class
definition
,
these
metrics
focus
on
evaluating
classes
.
The
metrics
discussed
here
were
proposed
in
[
21
]
.
We
discuss
some
of
these
metrics
that
were
experimentally
found
to
be
most
useful
in
predicting
fault-proneness

Weighted
Methods
per
Class
(
WMC
)
The
effort
in
developing
a
class
will
in
some
sense
will
be
determined
by
the
number
of
methods
the
class
has
and
the
complexity
of
the
methods
.
Hence
,
a
complexity
metric
that
combines
the
number
of
methods
and
the
complexity
of
methods
can
be
useful
in
estimating
the
overall
complexity
of
the
class
.
The
weighted
methods
per
class
(
WMC
)
metric
does
precisely
this
.
Suppose
a
class
C
has
methods
M1
,
M2
,
...
,
Mn
defined
on
it
.
Let
the
com-
plexity
of
the
method
Mi
be
ci
.
As
a
method
is
like
a
regular
function
or
pro-
cedure
,
any
complexity
metric
that
is
applicable
for
functions
can
be
used
to
define
ci
(
e.g.
,
estimated
size
,
interface
complexity
,
and
data
flow
complexity
)
.
The
WMC
is
defined
as
If
the
complexity
of
each
method
is
considered
to
be
1
,
WMC
gives
the
total
number
of
methods
in
the
class

)
Inheritance
is
,
as
we
have
mentioned
,
one
of
the
unique
features
of
the
object-oriented
paradigm
.
As
we
have
said
before
,
inheritance
is
one
of
the
main
mechanisms
for
reuse
in
OOD—the
deeper
a
particular
class
is
in
a
class
hierarchy
,
the
more
methods
it
has
available
for
reuse
,
thereby
providing
a
larger
reuse
potential
.
At
the
same
time
,
as
we
have
mentioned
,
inheritance
increases
coupling
,
which
makes
changing
a
class
harder
.
In
other
words
,
a
class
deep
in
the
hierarchy
has
a
lot
of
methods
it
can
inherit
,
which
makes
it
difficult
to
predict
its
behavior
.
For
both
these
reasons
,
it
is
useful
to
have
some
metric
to
quantify
inheritance
.
The
depth
of
inheritance
tree
(
DIT
)
is
one
such
metric
.
The
DIT
of
a
class
C
in
an
inheritance
hierarchy
is
the
depth
from
the
root
class
in
the
inheritance
tree
.
In
other
words
,
it
is
the
length
of
the
shortest
path
from
the
root
of
the
tree
to
the
node
representing
C
or
the
number
of
ancestors
C
has
.
In
case
of
multiple
inheritance
,
the
DIT
metric
is
the
maximum
length
from
a
root
to
C
.
Coupling
between
Classes
(
CBC
)
Coupling
between
classes
(
CBC
)
is
a
metric
that
tries
to
quantify
coupling
that
exists
between
classes
.
The
CBC
value
for
a
class
C
is
the
total
number
of
other
classes
to
which
the
class
is
coupled
.
Two
classes
are
considered
coupled
if
methods
of
one
class
use
methods
or
instance
variables
defined
in
the
other
class
.
In
general
,
whether
two
classes
are
coupled
can
easily
be
determined
by
looking
at
the
code
and
the
definitions
of
all
the
methods
of
the
two
classes
.
However
,
note
that
there
are
indirect
forms
of
coupling
(
through
pointers
,
etc
.
)
that
are
hard
to
identify
by
evaluating
the
code
.
Response
for
a
Class
(
RFC
)
Although
the
CBC
for
a
class
captures
the
number
of
other
classes
to
which
this
class
is
coupled
,
it
does
not
quantify
the
“
strength
”
of
interconnection
.
In
other
words
,
it
does
not
explain
the
degree
of
connection
of
methods
of
a
class
with
other
classes
.
Response
for
a
class
(
RFC
)
tries
to
quantify
this
by
capturing
the
total
number
of
methods
that
can
be
invoked
from
an
object
of
this
class
.
The
RFC
value
for
a
class
C
is
the
cardinality
of
the
response
set
for
a
class
.
The
response
set
of
a
class
C
is
the
set
of
all
methods
that
can
be
invoked
if
a
message
is
sent
to
an
object
of
this
class
.
This
includes
all
the
methods
of
C
and
of
other
classes
to
which
any
method
of
C
sends
a
message
.
It
is
clear
that
even
if
the
CBC
value
of
a
class
is
1
(
that
is
,
it
is
coupled
with
only
one
class
)
,
the
RFC
value
may
be
quite
high
,
indicating
that
the
“
volume
”
of
interaction
between
the
two
classes
is
very
high
.
It
should
be
clear
that
it
is
likely
to
be
harder
to
test
classes
that
have
higher
RFC
values
.
The
design
of
a
system
is
a
plan
for
a
solution
such
that
if
the
plan
is
implemented
,
the
implemented
system
will
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
system
and
will
preserve
its
architecture
.
The
module-level
design
specifies
the
modules
that
should
be
there
in
the
system
to
implement
the
architecture
,
and
the
detailed
design
the
processing
logic
of
modules
.
A
system
is
considered
modular
if
each
module
has
a
well-defined
abstrac-
tion
and
if
change
in
one
module
has
minimal
impact
on
other
modules
.
Two
criteria
used
for
evaluating
the
modularity
of
a
design
are
coupling
and
cohe-
sion
.
Coupling
reflects
how
interdependent
are
modules
on
each
other
,
while
cohesion
is
a
measure
of
the
strength
with
which
the
different
elements
of
a
module
are
related
.
In
general
,
in
a
design
coupling
should
be
minimized
and
cohesion
maximized
.
A
design
should
also
support
the
open-closed
principle
,
that
is
,
the
modules
are
such
that
they
are
open
for
extension
but
closed
for
modification
.
A
structure
chart
for
a
procedural
system
represents
the
modules
in
the
system
and
the
call
relationship
between
them
.
The
structured
design
methodology
gives
guidelines
on
how
to
create
a
design
(
represented
as
a
structure
chart
)
such
that
the
modules
have
minimum
dependence
on
each
other
(
low
coupling
)
and
a
high
level
of
cohesion
.
For
this
,
the
methodology
partitions
the
system
at
the
very
top
level
into
various
subsystems
,
one
for
managing
each
major
input
,
one
for
managing
each
major
output
,
and
one
for
each
major
transformation
.
This
cleanly
partitions
the
system
into
parts
each
independently
dealing
with
different
concerns
.
The
Universal
Modeling
Language
(
UML
)
has
various
types
of
diagrams
to
model
different
properties
,
which
allow
both
static
structure
as
well
as
dynamic
behavior
to
be
modeled
.
For
representing
the
static
structure
,
the
main
diagram
is
the
class
diagram
,
which
represents
the
classes
in
the
system
and
relationships
between
the
classes
.
For
modeling
the
dynamic
behavior
,
sequence
or
collaboration
diagrams
may
be
used
to
show
how
a
scenario
is
implemented
by
involving
different
objects
.
Using
the
UML
notation
,
OO
designs
of
a
system
can
be
created
.
The
OO
design
methodology
focuses
on
identifying
classes
and
relationships
between
them
,
and
validating
the
class
definitions
using
dynamic
and
functional
mod-
eling
.
In
detailed
design
of
procedures
,
the
logic
for
implementing
the
procedure
is
specified
in
a
semiformal
notation
.
For
classes
,
state
diagrams
can
be
used
to
model
the
relationships
between
methods
.
The
most
common
method
for
verifying
a
design
is
design
reviews
,
in
which
a
team
of
people
reviews
the
design
for
the
purpose
of
finding
defects
.
There
are
a
number
of
metrics
that
can
be
used
to
evaluate
the
complex-
ity
of
a
design
.
Network
metrics
evaluate
the
structure
chart
and
consider
deviation
from
the
tree
as
the
metric
signifying
the
quality
of
design
.
The
information
flow
complexity
metrics
define
design
complexity
based
on
the
internal
complexity
of
the
module
and
the
number
of
connections
between
modules
.
These
can
be
used
to
identify
error-prone
modules
,
and
improve
the
design
by
reducing
their
complexity
.
For
the
complexity
of
an
object-oriented
design
,
metrics
like
weighted
methods
per
class
,
the
depth
of
inheritance
tree
of
a
class
,
and
maximum
depth
in
the
class
hierarchy
of
this
class
can
be
used
.

The
goal
of
the
coding
or
programming
activity
is
to
implement
the
design
in
the
best
possible
manner
.
The
coding
activity
affects
both
testing
and
main-
tenance
profoundly
.
As
we
saw
earlier
,
the
time
spent
in
coding
is
a
small
percentage
of
the
total
software
cost
,
while
testing
and
maintenance
consume
the
major
portion
.
Thus
,
it
should
be
clear
that
the
goal
during
coding
should
not
be
just
to
reduce
the
implementation
cost
,
but
help
reduce
the
cost
of
later
phases
.
During
coding
,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
programs
should
not
be
constructed
so
that
they
are
easy
to
write
,
but
in
a
manner
that
they
are
easy
to
read
and
understand
.
A
program
is
read
a
lot
more
often
and
by
a
lot
more
people
during
the
later
phases
.
Having
readability
and
understandability
as
a
clear
objective
of
the
cod-
ing
activity
can
itself
help
in
achieving
it
.
A
famous
experiment
by
Weinberg
showed
that
if
programmers
are
specified
a
clear
objective
for
the
program
,
they
usually
satisfy
it
[
82
]
.
In
the
experiment
,
five
different
teams
were
given
the
same
problem
for
which
they
had
to
develop
programs
.
However
,
each
of
the
teams
was
specified
a
different
objective
,
which
it
had
to
satisfy
.
The
different
objectives
given
were
:
minimize
the
effort
required
to
complete
the
program
,
minimize
the
number
of
statements
,
minimize
the
memory
required
,
maximize
the
program
clarity
,
and
maximize
the
output
clarity
.
It
was
found
that
in
most
cases
each
team
did
the
best
for
the
objective
that
was
specified
to
it
.
The
rank
of
the
different
teams
for
the
different
objectives
is
shown
in
Table
.
The
experiment
clearly
shows
that
if
objectives
are
clear
,
programmers
tend
to
achieve
that
objective
.
Hence
,
if
readability
is
an
objective
of
the
coding
activity
,
then
it
is
likely
that
programmers
will
develop
easily

that
if
the
focus
is
on
minimizing

takes
a
big
hit
.
For
our
purposes
,
ease
of
understanding
and
modification
are
the
basic
goals
of
the
programming
activity
.

process
that
can
be

.
The
main
task
before
a
programmer
is
to
write
readable
code
with
few
bugs
in
it
.
An
additional
goal
is
to
write
code
quickly
.
Writing
solid
code
is
a
skill
that
can
only
be
acquired
by
practice
.
However
,
based
on
experience
,
some
general
rules
and
guidelines
can
be
given
for
the
programmer
.
Good
programming
(
producing
correct
and
simple
programs
)
is
a
practice
independent
of
the
target
programming
language
,
although
well-structured
programming
languages
make
the
programmer
’
s
job
simpler
.
In
this
section
,
we
will
discuss
some
concepts
and
practices
that
can
help
a
programmer
write
higher-quality
code
that
is
also
easier
to
understand
.
As
stated
earlier
the
basic
objective
of
the
coding
activity
is
to
produce
pro-
grams
that
are
easy
to
understand
.
It
has
been
argued
by
many
that
structured
programming
practice
helps
develop
programs
that
are
easier
to
understand
.
The
structured
programming
movement
started
in
the
1970s
,
and
much
has
been
said
and
written
about
it
.
Now
the
concept
pervades
so
much
that
it
is
generally
accepted—even
implied—that
programming
should
be
structured
.
Though
a
lot
of
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
structured
programming
,
the
con-
cept
and
motivation
behind
structured
programming
are
often
not
well
under-
stood
.
Structured
programming
is
often
regarded
as
“
goto-less
”
programming
.
Although
extensive
use
of
gotos
is
certainly
not
desirable
,
structured
programs
can
be
written
with
the
use
of
gotos
.
Here
we
provide
a
brief
discussion
on
what
structured
programming
is
.
A
program
has
a
static
structure
as
well
as
a
dynamic
structure
.
The
static
structure
is
the
structure
of
the
text
of
the
program
,
which
is
just
a
linear
orga-
nization
of
statements
of
the
program
.
The
dynamic
structure
of
the
program
is
the
sequence
of
statements
executed
during
the
execution
of
the
program
.
In
other
words
,
both
the
static
structure
and
the
dynamic
behavior
are
sequences
of
statements
;
while
the
sequence
representing
the
static
structure
of
a
program
is
fixed
,
the
sequence
of
statements
it
executes
can
change
from
execution
to
execution
.
It
will
clearly
be
easier
to
understand
the
dynamic
behavior
if
the
structure
in
the
dynamic
behavior
resembles
the
static
structure
.
The
closer
the
corre-
spondence
between
execution
and
text
structure
,
the
easier
the
program
is
to
understand
,
and
the
more
different
the
structure
during
execution
,
the
harder
it
will
be
to
argue
about
the
behavior
from
the
program
text
.
The
goal
of
structured
programming
is
to
ensure
that
the
static
structure
and
the
dynamic
structures
are
the
same
.
That
is
,
the
objective
of
structured
programming
is
to
write
programs
so
that
the
sequence
of
statements
executed
during
the
ex-
ecution
of
a
program
is
the
same
as
the
sequence
of
statements
in
the
text
of
that
program
.
As
the
statements
in
a
program
text
are
linearly
organized
,
the
objective
of
structured
programming
becomes
developing
programs
whose
control
flow
during
execution
is
linearized
and
follows
the
linear
organization
of
the
program
text
.
The
real
motivation
for
structured
programming
,
however
,
was
formal
ver-
ification
of
programs
.
To
show
that
a
program
is
correct
,
we
need
to
show
that
when
the
program
executes
,
its
behavior
is
what
is
expected
.
For
specifying
the
behavior
,
we
need
to
specify
the
conditions
the
output
of
the
program
should
satisfy
.
As
a
program
will
usually
not
operate
on
an
arbitrary
set
of
input
data
and
may
produce
valid
results
only
for
some
range
of
inputs
,
we
generally
need
to
also
state
the
input
conditions
in
which
the
program
is
to
be
invoked
and
for
which
the
program
is
expected
to
produce
valid
results
.
The
assertion
about
the
expected
final
state
of
a
program
is
called
the
post-condition
of
that
pro-
gram
,
and
the
assertion
about
the
input
condition
is
called
the
pre-condition
of
the
program
.
Often
,
in
program
verification
,
determining
the
pre-condition
for
which
the
post-condition
will
be
satisfied
is
the
goal
of
proof
.
Using
Hoare
’
s
notation
[
50
]
,
for
verifying
a
program
,
the
basic
assertion
about
a
program
segment
is
of
the
form
The
interpretation
of
this
is
that
if
assertion
P
is
true
before
executing
S
,
then
assertion
Q
will
be
true
after
executing
S
,
if
the
execution
of
S
terminates
.
Assertion
P
is
the
pre-condition
of
the
program
and
Q
is
the
post-condition
.
These
assertions
are
about
the
values
taken
by
the
variables
in
the
program
before
and
after
its
execution
.
The
assertions
generally
do
not
specify
a
par-
ticular
value
for
the
variables
,
but
they
specify
the
general
properties
of
the
values
and
the
relationships
among
them
.
For
verification
of
larger
programs
,
we
would
like
to
make
assertions
about
the
program
from
assertions
about
its
components
or
statements
.
If
the
program
is
a
sequence
of
statements
,
then
determining
the
semantics
of
a
composite
program
becomes
easier
.
If
a
statement
S
is
composed
of
two
statements
S2
,
which
are
to
be
executed
in
sequence
,
then
from
the
semantics
of
S2
,
we
can
easily
determine
the
semantics
of
S
(
this
rule
is
called
rule
of
composition
in
[
50
]
)
as
follows
:
The
explanation
of
this
notation
is
that
if
what
is
stated
in
the
numerator
can
be
proved
,
the
denominator
can
be
inferred
.
Using
this
rule
,
if
we
have
proved
P2
,
then
to
determine
the
semantics
of
S1
;
S2
,
all
we
need
to
show
is
that
Q2
,
and
then
we
can
claim
that
if
before
execution
the
pre-condition
P
,
then
after
execution
of
S1
;
S-condition
Q
.
In
other
words
,
to
prove
P
S1
;
S
,
once
we
have
determined
the
behaviors
of
S2
,
we
just
need
one
additional
step
.
This
allows
building
proofs
of
larger
programs
from
proofs
of
its
elements
.
Note
that
the
rule
handles
a
strict
sequence
of
statements
only
.
So
,
if
we
want
to
apply
this
,
we
need
to
construct
the
program
as
a
sequence
of
statements
.
And
that
is
the
verification
motivation
of
wanting
to
linearize
the
control
flow
in
a
program
.
Clearly
,
no
meaningful
program
can
be
written
as
a
sequence
of
simple
statements
without
any
branching
or
repetition
(
which
also
involves
branching
)
.
So
,
how
is
the
objective
of
linearizing
the
control
flow
to
be
achieved
?
By
making
use
of
structured
constructs
.
In
structured
programming
,
a
statement
is
not
a
simple
assignment
statement
,
it
is
a
structured
statement
.
The
key
property
of
a
structured
statement
is
that
it
has
a
single-entry
and
a
single-exit
.
That
is
,
during
execution
,
the
execution
of
the
(
structured
)
statement
starts
from
one
defined
point
and
the
execution
terminates
at
one
defined
point
.
With
single-entry
and
single-exit
statements
,
we
can
view
a
program
as
a
sequence
of
(
structured
)
statements
.
And
if
all
statements
are
structured
statements
,
then
during
execution
,
the
sequence
of
execution
of
these
statements
will
be
the
same
as
the
sequence
in
the
program
text
.
Hence
,
by
using
single-entry
and
single-exit
statements
,
the
correspondence
between
the
static
and
dynamic
structures
can
be
obtained
.
The
most
commonly
used
single-entry
and
single-exit
statements
are
It
can
be
shown
that
these
three
basic
constructs
are
sufficient
to
program
any
conceivable
algorithm
.
Modern
languages
have
other
such
constructs
that
help
linearize
the
control
flow
of
a
program
,
which
,
generally
speaking
,
makes
it
easier
to
understand
a
program
.
Hence
,
programs
should
be
written
so
that
,
as
far
as
possible
,
single-entry
,
single-exit
control
constructs
are
used
.
The
basic
goal
,
as
we
have
tried
to
emphasize
,
is
to
make
the
logic
of
the
program
simple
to
understand
.
No
hard-and-fast
rule
can
be
formulated
that
will
be
applicable
under
all
circumstances
.
Structured
programming
practice
forms
a
good
basis
and
guideline
for
writing
programs
clearly
.
A
final
note
about
the
structured
constructs
.
Any
piece
of
code
with
a
single-
entry
and
single-exit
can
not
be
considered
a
structured
construct
.
If
that
is
the
case
,
one
could
always
define
appropriate
units
in
any
program
to
make
it
ap-
pear
as
a
sequence
of
these
units
(
in
the
worst
case
,
the
whole
program
could
be
defined
to
be
a
unit
)
.
The
basic
objective
of
using
structured
constructs
is
to
linearize
the
control
flow
so
that
the
execution
behavior
is
easier
to
under-
stand
and
argue
about
.
In
linearized
control
flow
,
if
we
understand
the
behavior
of
each
of
the
basic
constructs
properly
,
the
behavior
of
the
program
can
be
considered
a
composition
of
the
behaviors
of
the
different
statements
.
For
this
approach
to
work
,
it
is
implied
that
we
can
clearly
understand
and
specify
the
behavior
of
each
construct
.
This
requires
that
we
be
able
to
succinctly
capture
or
describe
the
behavior
of
each
construct
.
Unless
we
can
do
this
,
it
will
not
be
possible
to
compose
them
.
Clearly
,
for
an
arbitrary
structure
,
we
can
not
do
this
merely
because
it
has
a
single-entry
and
single-exit
.
It
is
from
this
view-
point
that
the
structures
mentioned
earlier
are
chosen
as
structured
statements
.
There
are
well-defined
rules
that
specify
how
these
statements
behave
during
execution
,
which
allows
us
to
argue
about
larger
programs
.
Overall
,
it
can
be
said
that
structured
programming
leads
to
programs
that
are
easier
to
understand
than
unstructured
programs
,
and
that
such
programs
are
easier
to
formally
prove
.
However
,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
structured
programming
is
not
an
end
in
itself
.
Our
basic
objective
is
that
the
program
be
easy
to
understand
.
And
structured
programming
is
a
safe
approach
for
achieving
this
objective
.
Still
,
there
are
some
common
programming
practices
that
are
now
well
understood
that
make
use
of
unstructured
constructs
(
e.g.
,
break
statement
,
continue
statement
)
.
Although
efforts
should
be
made
to
avoid
using
statements
that
effectively
violate
the
single-entry
single-exit
property
,
if
the
use
of
such
statements
is
the
simplest
way
to
organize
the
program
,
then
from
the
point
of
view
of
readability
,
the
constructs
should
be
used
.
The
main
point
is
that
any
unstructured
construct
should
be
used
only
if
the
structured
alternative
is
harder
to
understand
.
This
view
can
be
taken
only
because
we
are
focusing
on
readability
.
If
the
objective
was
formal
verifiability
,
structured
programming
will
probably
be
necessary
.
A
software
solution
to
a
problem
always
contains
data
structures
that
are
meant
to
represent
information
in
the
problem
domain
.
That
is
,
when
software
is
developed
to
solve
a
problem
,
the
software
uses
some
data
structures
to
capture
the
information
in
the
problem
domain
.
In
general
,
only
certain
operations
are
performed
on
some
information
.
That
is
,
a
piece
of
information
in
the
problem
domain
is
used
only
in
a
limited
number
of
ways
in
the
problem
domain
.
For
example
,
a
ledger
in
an
accountant
’
s
office
has
some
very
defined
uses
:
debit
,
credit
,
check
the
current
balance
,
etc
.
An
operation
where
all
debits
are
multiplied
together
and
then
divided
by
the
sum
of
all
credits
is
typically
not
performed
.
So
,
any
information
in
the
problem
domain
typically
has
a
small
number
of
defined
operations
performed
on
it
.
When
the
information
is
represented
as
data
structures
,
the
same
principle
should
be
applied
,
and
only
some
defined
operations
should
be
performed
on
the
data
structures
.
This
,
essentially
,
is
the
principle
of
information
hiding
.
The
information
captured
in
the
data
structures
should
be
hidden
from
the
rest
of
the
system
,
and
only
the
access
functions
on
the
data
structures
that
represent
the
operations
performed
on
the
information
should
be
visible
.
In
other
words
,
when
the
information
is
captured
in
data
structures
and
then
on
the
data
structures
that
represent
some
information
,
for
each
operation
on
the
information
an
access
function
should
be
provided
.
And
as
the
rest
of
the
system
in
the
problem
domain
only
performs
these
defined
operations
on
the
information
,
the
rest
of
the
modules
in
the
software
should
only
use
these
access
functions
to
access
and
manipulate
the
data
structures
.
Information
hiding
can
reduce
the
coupling
between
modules
and
make
the
system
more
maintainable
.
Information
hiding
is
also
an
effective
tool
for
managing
the
complexity
of
developing
software—by
using
information
hiding
we
have
separated
the
concern
of
managing
the
data
from
the
concern
of
using
the
data
to
produce
some
desired
results
.
Many
of
the
older
languages
,
like
Pascal
,
C
,
and
FORTRAN
,
do
not
pro-
vide
mechanisms
to
support
data
abstraction
.
With
such
languages
,
informa-
tion
hiding
can
be
supported
only
by
a
disciplined
use
of
the
language
.
That
is
,
the
access
restrictions
will
have
to
be
imposed
by
the
programmers
;
the
lan-
guage
does
not
provide
them
.
Most
modern
OO
languages
provide
linguistic
mechanisms
to
implement
information
hiding
.
The
concepts
discussed
above
can
help
in
writing
simple
and
clear
code
with
few
bugs
.
There
are
many
programming
practices
that
can
also
help
toward
that
objective
.
We
discuss
here
a
few
rules
that
have
been
found
to
make
code
easier
to
read
as
well
as
avoid
some
of
the
errors
.
Control
Constructs
:
As
discussed
earlier
,
it
is
desirable
that
as
much
as
possible
single-entry
,
single-exit
constructs
be
used
.
It
is
also
desirable
to
use
a
few
standard
control
constructs
rather
than
using
a
wide
variety
of
constructs
,
just
because
they
are
available
in
the
language
.
Gotos
:
Gotos
should
be
used
sparingly
and
in
a
disciplined
manner
.
Only
when
the
alternative
to
using
gotos
is
more
complex
should
the
gotos
be
used
.
In
any
case
,
alternatives
must
be
thought
of
before
finally
using
a
goto
.
If
a
goto
must
be
used
,
forward
transfers
(
or
a
jump
to
a
later
statement
)
is
more
acceptable
than
a
backward
jump
.
Information
Hiding
:
As
discussed
earlier
,
information
hiding
should
be
supported
where
possible
.
Only
the
access
functions
for
the
data
structures
should
be
made
visible
while
hiding
the
data
structure
behind
these
functions
.
User-Defined
Types
:
Modern
languages
allow
users
to
define
types
like
the
enumerated
type
.
When
such
facilities
are
available
,
they
should
be
ex-
ploited
where
applicable
.
For
example
,
when
working
with
dates
,
a
type
can
be
defined
for
the
day
of
the
week
.
Using
such
a
type
makes
the
program
much
clearer
than
defining
codes
for
each
day
and
then
working
with
codes
.
Nesting
:
If
nesting
of
if-then-else
constructs
becomes
too
deep
,
then
the
logic
become
harder
to
understand
.
In
case
of
deeply
nested
if-then-elses
,
it
is
often
difficult
to
determine
the
if
statement
to
which
a
particular
else
clause
is
associated
.
Where
possible
,
deep
nesting
should
be
avoided
,
even
if
it
means
a
little
inefficiency
.
For
example
,
consider
the
following
construct
of
nested
if-then-elses
:
If
the
different
conditions
are
disjoint
(
as
they
often
are
)
,
this
structure
can
be
converted
into
the
following
structure
:
This
sequence
of
statements
will
produce
the
same
result
as
the
earlier
sequence
(
if
the
conditions
are
disjoint
)
,
but
it
is
much
easier
to
understand
.
The
price
is
a
little
inefficiency
.
Module
Size
:
We
discussed
this
issue
during
system
design
.
A
programmer
should
carefully
examine
any
function
with
too
many
statements
(
say
more
than
100
)
.
Large
modules
often
will
not
be
functionally
cohesive
.
There
can
be
no
hard-and-fast
rule
about
module
sizes
;
the
guiding
principle
should
be
cohesion
and
coupling
.
Module
Interface
:
A
module
with
a
complex
interface
should
be
carefully
examined
.
As
a
rule
of
thumb
,
any
module
whose
interface
has
more
than
five
parameters
should
be
carefully
examined
and
broken
into
multiple
modules
with
a
simpler
interface
if
possible
.
Side
Effects
:
When
a
module
is
invoked
,
it
sometimes
has
side
effects
of
modifying
the
program
state
beyond
the
modification
of
parameters
listed
in
the
module
interface
definition
,
for
example
,
modifying
global
variables
.
Such
side
effects
should
be
avoided
where
possible
,
and
if
a
module
has
side
effects
,
they
should
be
properly
documented
.
Robustness
:
A
program
is
robust
if
it
does
something
planned
even
for
exceptional
conditions
.
A
program
might
encounter
exceptional
conditions
in
such
forms
as
incorrect
input
,
the
incorrect
value
of
some
variable
,
and
overflow
.
If
such
situations
do
arise
,
the
program
should
not
just
“
crash
”
or
“
core
dump
”
;
it
should
produce
some
meaningful
message
and
exit
gracefully
.
Switch
Case
with
Default
:
If
there
is
no
default
case
in
a
“
switch
”
statement
,
the
behavior
can
be
unpredictable
if
that
case
arises
at
some
point
of
time
which
was
not
predictable
at
development
stage
.
Such
a
practice
can
result
in
a
bug
like
NULL
dereference
,
memory
leak
,
as
well
as
other
types
of
serious
bugs
.
It
is
a
good
practice
to
always
include
a
default
case
.
s
[
0
]
=
y
;
/
*
NULL
dereference
if
default
occurs
*
/
Empty
Catch
Block
:
An
exception
is
caught
,
but
if
there
is
no
action
,
it
may
represent
a
scenario
where
some
of
the
operations
to
be
done
are
not
performed
.
Whenever
exceptions
are
caught
,
it
is
a
good
practice
to
take
some
default
action
,
even
if
it
is
just
printing
an
error
message
.
File
InputStream
fis
=
new
File
InputStream
(
``
InputFile
``
)
;
Empty
if
,
while
Statement
:
A
condition
is
checked
but
nothing
is
done
based
on
the
check
.
This
often
occurs
due
to
some
mistake
and
should
be
caught
.
Other
similar
errors
include
empty
finally
,
try
,
synchronized
,
empty
static
method
,
etc
.
Such
useless
checks
should
be
avoided
.
if
(
x
==
0
)
{
}
/
*
nothing
is
done
after
checking
x
*
/
else
{
Read
Return
to
Be
Checked
:
Often
the
return
value
from
reads
is
not
checked
,
assuming
that
the
read
returns
the
desired
values
.
Sometimes
the
result
from
a
read
can
be
different
from
what
is
expected
,
and
this
can
cause
failures
later
.
There
may
be
some
cases
where
neglecting
this
condition
may
result
in
some
serious
error
.
For
example
,
if
read
from
scanf
(
)
is
more
than
expected
,
then
it
may
cause
a
buffer
overflow
.
Hence
,
the
value
of
read
should
be
checked
before
accessing
the
data
read
.
(
This
is
the
reason
why
most
languages
provide
a
return
value
for
the
read
operation
.
)
Return
from
Finally
Block
:
One
should
not
return
from
finally
block
,
as
it
can
create
false
beliefs
.
For
example
,
consider
the
code
throw
new
Exception
(
``
An
Exception
``
)
;
In
this
example
,
a
value
is
returned
both
in
exception
and
nonexception
sce-
narios
.
Hence
,
at
the
caller
site
,
the
user
will
not
be
able
to
distinguish
between
the
two
.
Another
interesting
case
arises
when
we
have
a
return
from
try
block
.
In
this
case
,
if
there
is
a
return
in
finally
also
,
then
the
value
from
finally
is
returned
instead
of
the
value
from
try
.
Correlated
Parameters
:
Often
there
is
an
implicit
correlation
between
the
parameters
.
For
example
,
in
the
code
segment
given
below
,
“
length
”
rep-
resents
the
size
of
BUFFER
.
If
the
correlation
does
not
hold
,
we
can
run
into
a
serious
problem
like
buffer
overflow
(
illustrated
in
the
code
fragment
below
)
.
Hence
,
it
is
a
good
practice
to
validate
this
correlation
rather
than
assuming
that
it
holds
.
In
general
,
it
is
desirable
to
do
some
counter
checks
on
implicit
assumptions
about
parameters
.
void
(
char
*
src
,
int
length
,
char
destn
[
]
)
{
strcpy
(
destn
,
src
)
;
/
*
Can
cause
buffer
overflow
Trusted
Data
Sources
:
Counter
checks
should
be
made
before
accessing
the
input
data
,
particularly
if
the
input
data
is
being
provided
by
the
user
or
is
being
obtained
over
the
network
.
For
example
,
while
doing
the
string
copy
operation
,
we
should
check
that
the
source
string
is
null
terminated
,
or
that
its
size
is
as
we
expect
.
Similar
is
the
case
with
some
network
data
which
may
be
sniffed
and
prone
to
some
modifications
or
corruptions
.
To
avoid
problems
due
to
these
changes
,
we
should
put
some
checks
,
like
parity
checks
,
hashes
,
etc.
,
to
ensure
the
validity
of
the
incoming
data
.
Give
Importance
to
Exceptions
:
Most
programmers
tend
to
give
less
attention
to
the
possible
exceptional
cases
and
tend
to
work
with
the
main
flow
of
events
,
control
,
and
data
.
Though
the
main
work
is
done
in
the
main
path
,
it
is
the
exceptional
paths
that
often
cause
software
systems
to
fail
.
To
make
a
software
system
more
reliable
,
a
programmer
should
consider
all
possibilities
and
write
suitable
exception
handlers
to
prevent
failures
or
loss
when
such
Programmers
spend
far
more
time
reading
code
than
writing
code
.
Over
the
life
of
the
code
,
the
author
spends
a
considerable
time
reading
it
during
debugging
and
enhancement
.
People
other
than
the
author
also
spend
considerable
effort
in
reading
code
because
the
code
is
often
maintained
by
someone
other
than
the
author
.
In
short
,
it
is
of
prime
importance
to
write
code
in
a
manner
that
is
easy
to
read
and
understand
.
Coding
standards
provide
rules
and
guidelines
for
some
aspects
of
programming
in
order
to
make
code
easier
to
read
.
Most
organizations
who
develop
software
regularly
develop
their
own
standards
.
In
general
,
coding
standards
provide
guidelines
for
programmers
regarding
naming
,
file
organization
,
statements
and
declarations
,
and
layout
and
com-
ments
.
To
give
an
idea
of
coding
standards
(
often
called
conventions
or
style
guidelines
)
,
we
discuss
some
guidelines
for
Java
,
based
on
publicly
available
standards
(
from
or
java.sun.com/docs
)
.
Naming
Conventions
Some
of
the
standard
naming
conventions
that
are
fol-
lowed
often
are
:
Package
names
should
be
in
lowercase
(
e.g.
,
mypackage
,
edu.iitk.maths
)
.
Type
names
should
be
nouns
and
should
start
with
uppercase
(
e.g.
,
Day
,
DateOfBirth
,
EventHandler
)
.
Variable
names
should
be
nouns
starting
with
lowercase
(
e.g.
,
name
,
amount
)
.
Constant
names
should
be
all
uppercase
(
e.g.
,
PI
,
MAX
ITERATIONS
)
.
Method
names
should
be
verbs
starting
with
lowercase
(
e.g.
,
getValue
(
)
)
.
Private
class
variables
should
have
the
suffix
(
e.g.
,
“
private
int
value
”
)
.
(
Some
standards
will
require
this
to
be
a
prefix
.
)
Variables
with
a
large
scope
should
have
long
names
;
variables
with
a
small
scope
can
have
short
names
;
loop
iterators
should
be
named
i
,
j
,
k
,
etc
.
The
prefix
is
should
be
used
for
Boolean
variables
and
methods
to
avoid
confusion
(
e.g.
,
isStatus
should
be
used
instead
of
status
)
;
negative
boolean
variable
names
(
e.g.
,
isNotCorrect
)
should
be
avoided
.
The
term
compute
can
be
used
for
methods
where
something
is
being
com-
puted
;
the
term
find
can
be
used
where
something
is
being
looked
up
(
e.g.
,
computeMean
(
)
,
findMin
(
)
)
.
Exception
classes
should
be
suffixed
with
Exception
(
e.g.
,
OutOfBoundEx-
ception
)
.
Files
There
are
conventions
on
how
files
should
be
named
,
and
what
files
should
contain
,
such
that
a
reader
can
get
some
idea
about
what
the
file
con-
tains
.
Some
examples
of
these
conventions
are
:
Java
source
files
should
have
the
extension
.java—this
is
enforced
by
most
compilers
and
tools
.
Each
file
should
contain
one
outer
class
and
the
class
name
should
be
the
same
as
the
file
name
.
Line
length
should
be
limited
to
less
than
80
columns
and
special
charac-
ters
should
be
avoided
.
If
the
line
is
longer
,
it
should
be
continued
and
the
continuation
should
be
made
very
clear
.
Statements
These
guidelines
are
for
the
declaration
and
executable
state-
ments
in
the
source
code
.
Some
examples
are
given
below
.
Note
,
however
,
that
not
everyone
will
agree
on
these
.
That
is
why
organizations
generally
develop
their
own
guidelines
that
can
be
followed
without
restricting
the
flexibility
of
programmers
for
the
type
of
work
the
organization
does
.
Variables
should
be
initialized
where
declared
,
and
they
should
be
declared
in
the
smallest
possible
scope
.
Declare
related
variables
together
in
a
common
statement
.
Unrelated
vari-
ables
should
not
be
declared
in
the
same
statement
.
Loop
variables
should
be
initialized
immediately
before
the
loop
.
Avoid
complex
conditional
expressions—introduce
temporary
boolean
vari-
ables
instead
.
Commenting
and
Layout
Comments
are
textual
statements
that
are
meant
for
the
program
reader
to
aid
the
understanding
of
code
.
The
purpose
of
com-
ments
is
not
to
explain
in
English
the
logic
of
the
program—if
the
logic
is
so
complex
that
it
requires
comments
to
explain
it
,
it
is
better
to
rewrite
and
simplify
the
code
instead
.
In
general
,
comments
should
explain
what
the
code
is
doing
or
why
the
code
is
there
,
so
that
the
code
can
become
almost
stan-
dalone
for
understanding
the
system
.
Comments
should
generally
be
provided
for
blocks
of
code
,
and
in
many
cases
,
only
comments
for
the
modules
need
to
be
provided
.
Providing
comments
for
modules
is
most
useful
,
as
modules
form
the
unit
of
testing
,
compiling
,
verification
,
and
modification
.
Comments
for
a
module
are
often
called
prologue
for
the
module
,
which
describes
the
functionality
and
the
purpose
of
the
module
,
its
public
interface
and
how
the
module
is
to
be
used
,
parameters
of
the
interface
,
assumptions
it
makes
about
the
parameters
,
and
any
side
effects
it
has
.
Other
features
may
also
be
included
.
It
should
be
noted
that
prologues
are
useful
only
if
they
are
kept
consistent
with
the
logic
of
the
module
.
If
the
module
is
modified
,
then
the
prologue
should
also
be
modified
,
if
necessary
.
Java
provides
documentation
comments
that
are
delimited
by
“
/
*
*
...
*
/
”
,
and
which
could
be
extracted
to
HTML
files
.
These
comments
are
mostly
used
as
prologues
for
classes
and
its
methods
and
fields
,
and
are
meant
to
provide
documentation
to
users
of
the
classes
who
may
not
have
access
to
the
source
code
.
In
addition
to
prologue
for
modules
,
coding
standards
may
specify
how
and
where
comments
should
be
located
.
Some
such
guidelines
are
:
Single
line
comments
for
a
block
of
code
should
be
aligned
with
the
code
they
are
meant
for
.
There
should
be
comments
for
all
major
variables
explaining
what
they
rep-
resent
.
A
block
of
comments
should
be
preceded
by
a
blank
comment
line
with
just
“
/
*
”
and
ended
with
a
line
containing
just
“
*
/
”
.
Trailing
comments
after
statements
should
be
short
,
on
the
same
line
,
and
shifted
far
enough
to
separate
them
from
statements
.
Layout
guidelines
focus
on
how
a
program
should
be
indented
,
how
it
should
use
blank
lines
,
white
spaces
,
etc.
,
to
make
it
more
easily
readable
.
Indentation
guidelines
are
sometimes
provided
for
each
type
of
programming
construct
.
However
,
most
programmers
learn
these
by
seeing
the
code
of
others
and
the
code
fragments
in
books
and
documents
,
and
many
of
these
have
become
fairly
standard
over
the
years
.
We
will
not
discuss
them
further
except
to
say
that
a
programmer
should
use
some
conventions
,
and
use
them
consistently
.
The
coding
activity
starts
when
some
form
of
design
has
been
done
and
the
specifications
of
the
modules
to
be
developed
are
available
.
With
the
design
,
modules
are
assigned
to
developers
for
coding
.
When
modules
are
assigned
to
developers
,
they
use
some
process
for
developing
the
code
.
Clearly
,
a
wide
range
of
processes
are
possible
for
achieving
this
goal
.
Here
we
discuss
some
effective
processes
that
developers
use
for
incrementally
developing
code
.
The
process
followed
by
many
developers
is
to
write
the
code
for
the
currently
assigned
module
,
and
when
done
,
perform
unit
testing
on
it
and
fix
the
bugs
found
.
Then
the
code
is
checked
in
the
project
repository
to
make
it
available
to
others
in
the
project
.
(
We
will
explain
the
process
of
checking
in
later
.
)
A
better
process
for
coding
,
which
is
often
followed
by
experienced
developers
,
is
to
develop
the
code
incrementally
.
That
is
,
write
code
for
im-
plementing
only
part
of
the
functionality
of
the
module
.
This
code
is
compiled
and
tested
with
some
quick
tests
to
check
the
code
that
has
been
written
so
far
.
When
the
code
passes
these
tests
,
the
developer
proceeds
to
add
further
functionality
to
the
code
,
which
is
then
tested
again
.
In
other
words
,
the
code
is
developed
incrementally
,
testing
it
as
it
is
built
.
This
coding
process
is
shown
in
Figure
The
basic
advantage
of
developing
code
incrementally
with
testing
being
done
after
every
round
of
coding
is
to
facilitate
debugging—an
error
found
in
some
testing
can
be
safely
attributed
to
code
that
was
added
since
the
last
successful
testing
.
However
,
for
following
this
process
,
it
is
essential
that
testing
be
done
through
test
scripts
that
can
be
run
easily
.
With
these
test
scripts
,
testing
can
be
done
as
frequently
as
desired
,
and
new
test
cases
can
be
added
easily
.
These
test
scripts
are
also
a
tremendous
aid
when
code
is
enhanced
in
the
future—through
the
test
scripts
it
can
be
quickly
checked
that
the
earlier
functionality
is
still
working
.
These
test
scripts
can
also
be
used
with
some
enhancements
for
the
final
unit
testing
that
is
often
done
before
checking
in
the
module
.
Test-Driven
Development
(
TDD
)
[
8
]
is
a
coding
process
that
turns
around
the
common
approach
to
coding
.
Instead
of
writing
code
and
then
developing
test
cases
to
check
the
code
,
in
TDD
it
is
the
other
way
around—a
programmer
first
writes
the
test
scripts
,
and
then
writes
the
code
to
pass
the
tests
.
The
whole
process
is
done
incrementally
,
with
tests
being
written
based
on
the
specifications
and
code
being
written
to
pass
the
tests
.
The
TDD
process
is
shown
in
Figure
This
is
a
relatively
new
approach
,
which
has
been
adopted
in
the
extreme
programming
(
XP
)
methodology
[
7
]
.
The
concept
of
TDD
is
,
however
,
general
and
not
tied
to
any
particular
methodology
.
A
few
points
are
worth
noting
about
TDD
.
First
,
the
approach
says
that
you
write
just
enough
code
to
pass
the
tests
.
By
following
this
,
the
code
is
always
in
sync
with
the
tests
.
This
is
not
always
the
case
with
the
code-first
approach
,
in
which
it
is
all
too
common
to
write
a
long
piece
of
code
,
but
then
only
write
a
few
tests
which
cover
only
some
parts
of
the
code
.
By
encouraging
that
code
is
written
only
to
pass
the
tests
,
the
responsibility
of
ensuring
that
required
functionality
is
built
is
shifted
to
the
activity
of
designing
the
test
cases
.
That
is
,
it
is
the
task
of
test
cases
to
check
that
the
code
that
will
be
developed
has
all
the
functionality
needed
.
This
writing
of
test
cases
before
the
code
is
written
makes
the
development
usage-driven
.
Since
test
cases
have
to
be
written
first
from
the
specifications
,
how
the
code
is
to
be
used
gets
the
attention
first
.
This
helps
ensure
that
the
interfaces
are
from
the
perspective
of
the
user
of
the
code
and
that
key
usage
scenarios
.
This
can
help
reduce
interface
errors
.
In
TDD
,
some
type
of
prioritization
for
code
development
naturally
hap-
pens
.
It
is
most
likely
that
the
first
few
tests
are
likely
to
focus
on
using
the
main
functionality
.
Generally
,
the
test
cases
for
lower-priority
features
or
func-
tionality
will
be
developed
later
.
Consequently
,
code
for
high-priority
features
will
be
developed
first
and
lower-priority
items
will
be
developed
later
.
This
has
the
benefit
that
higher-priority
items
get
done
first
,
but
has
the
drawback
that
some
of
the
lower-priority
features
or
some
special
cases
for
which
test
cases
are
not
written
may
not
get
handled
in
the
code
.
As
the
code
is
written
to
satisfy
the
test
cases
,
the
completeness
of
the
code
depends
on
the
thoroughness
of
the
test
cases
.
Often
it
is
hard
and
tedious
to
write
test
cases
for
all
the
scenarios
or
special
conditions
,
and
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
a
developer
will
write
test
cases
for
all
the
special
cases
.
In
TDD
,
as
the
goal
is
to
write
enough
code
to
pass
the
test
cases
,
such
special
cases
may
not
get
handled
.
Also
,
as
at
each
step
code
is
being
written
primarily
to
pass
the
tests
,
it
may
later
be
found
that
earlier
algorithms
were
not
well
suited
.
In
that
case
,
the
code
should
be
improved
before
new
functionality
is
added
,
as
shown
in
Figure
Pair
programming
is
also
a
coding
process
that
has
been
proposed
as
a
key
tech-
nique
in
extreme
programming
(
XP
)
methodology
[
7
]
.
In
pair
programming
,
code
is
not
written
by
individual
programmers
but
by
a
pair
of
programmers
.
That
is
,
the
coding
work
is
assigned
not
to
an
individual
but
to
a
pair
of
individuals
.
This
pair
together
writes
the
code
.
The
process
envisaged
is
that
one
person
will
type
the
program
while
the
other
will
actively
participate
and
constantly
review
what
is
being
typed
.
When
errors
are
noticed
,
they
are
pointed
out
and
corrected
.
When
needed
,
the
pair
discusses
the
algorithms
,
data
structures
,
or
strategies
to
be
used
in
the
code
to
be
written
.
The
roles
are
rotated
frequently
making
both
equal
partners
and
having
similar
roles
.
The
basic
motivation
for
pair
programming
is
that
as
code
reading
and
code
reviews
have
been
found
to
be
very
effective
in
detecting
defects
,
by
having
a
pair
do
the
programming
we
have
the
situation
where
the
code
is
getting
reviewed
as
it
is
being
typed
.
That
is
,
instead
of
writing
code
and
then
getting
it
reviewed
by
another
programmer
,
we
have
a
programmer
who
is
constantly
reviewing
the
code
being
written
.
Like
incremental
development
and
testing
,
we
now
have
incremental
reviewing
taking
place
.
Besides
ongoing
code
review
,
having
two
programmers
apply
themselves
to
the
programming
task
at
hand
is
likely
to
result
in
better
decisions
being
taken
about
the
data
structures
,
algorithms
,
interfaces
,
logic
,
etc
.
Special
conditions
,
which
frequently
result
in
errors
,
are
also
more
likely
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
better
manner
.
The
potential
drawback
of
pair
programming
is
that
it
may
result
in
loss
of
productivity
by
assigning
two
people
for
a
programming
task
.
It
is
clear
that
a
pair
will
produce
better
code
as
compared
to
code
being
developed
by
a
single
programmer
.
The
open
question
is
whether
this
increase
in
productivity
due
to
improved
code
quality
offsets
the
loss
incurred
by
putting
two
people
on
a
task
.
There
are
also
issues
of
accountability
and
code
ownership
,
particularly
when
the
pairs
are
not
fixed
and
rotate
(
as
has
been
proposed
in
XP
)
.
Impact
of
pair
programming
is
an
active
area
of
research
,
particularly
for
experimental
software
engineering
.
During
the
coding
process
,
the
code
being
written
by
a
programmer
(
or
a
pair
)
evolves—starting
from
nothing
to
eventually
having
a
well-tested
module
.
During
this
process
the
code
undergoes
changes
.
Besides
the
changes
due
to
the
development
process
,
code
changes
are
also
needed
due
to
changes
in
module
specifications
,
which
may
come
about
due
to
requirement
changes
.
In
such
a
dynamic
scenario
,
managing
evolving
code
is
a
challenge
.
Here
we
discuss
two
aspects
of
this—how
to
manage
the
different
versions
that
get
created
,
and
how
to
maintain
code
quality
under
changes
.
In
a
project
many
different
people
develop
source
code
.
Each
programmer
cre-
ates
different
source
files
,
which
are
eventually
combined
together
to
create
executables
.
Programmers
keep
changing
their
source
files
as
the
code
evolves
,
as
we
have
seen
in
the
processes
discussed
above
,
and
often
make
changes
in
other
source
files
as
well
.
In
order
to
keep
control
over
the
sources
and
their
evolution
,
source
code
control
is
almost
always
used
in
projects
using
tools
like
the
CVS
on
UNIX
(
www.cvshome.org
)
or
visual
source
safe
(
VSS
)
on
Windows
(
msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/previous/ssafe
)
.
Here
we
give
a
brief
description
of
how
these
tools
are
used
in
the
coding
process
.
Our
discussion
is
based
on
CVS
.
A
modern
source
code
control
system
contains
a
repository
,
which
is
essen-
tially
a
controlled
directory
structure
,
which
keeps
the
full
revision
history
of
all
the
files
produced
by
the
different
programmers
in
the
project
team
.
For
efficiency
,
a
file
history
is
generally
kept
as
deltas
or
increments
from
the
base
file
.
This
allows
any
older
version
of
the
file
to
be
re-created
,
thereby
giving
the
flexibility
to
easily
discard
a
change
,
should
the
need
arise
.
The
repository
is
also
the
“
official
”
source
for
all
the
files
.
For
a
project
,
a
repository
has
to
be
set
up
with
permissions
for
different
people
in
the
project
.
The
files
the
repository
will
contain
are
also
specified—
these
are
the
files
whose
evolution
the
repository
maintains
.
Programmers
use
the
repository
to
make
their
source
file
changes
available
,
as
well
as
obtain
other
source
files
.
Some
of
the
types
of
commands
that
are
generally
performed
by
a
programmer
are
:
Get
a
local
copy
.
A
programmer
in
a
project
works
on
a
local
copy
of
the
file
.
Commands
are
provided
to
make
a
local
copy
from
the
repository
.
Making
a
local
copy
is
generally
called
a
checkout
.
An
example
command
is
cvs
checkout
<
module
>
,
which
copies
a
set
of
files
that
belongs
to
the
<
module
>
on
the
local
machine
.
A
user
will
get
the
latest
copy
of
the
file
.
However
,
if
a
user
wants
,
any
older
version
of
a
file
can
be
obtained
from
the
repository
,
as
the
complete
history
is
maintained
.
Many
users
can
check
out
a
file
.
Make
changes
to
file
(
s
)
.
The
changes
made
to
the
local
file
by
a
programmer
remain
local
until
the
changes
are
committed
back
on
the
repository
.
By
committing
(
e.g.
,
by
cvs
commit
<
file
>
)
the
changes
made
to
the
local
file
are
made
to
the
repository
,
and
are
hence
available
to
others
.
This
operation
is
also
referred
to
as
check
in
.
Update
a
local
copy
.
Changes
committed
by
project
members
to
the
repository
are
not
reflected
in
the
local
copies
that
were
made
before
the
changes
were
committed
.
For
getting
the
changes
,
the
local
copies
of
the
files
have
to
be
updated
(
e.g.
,
by
cvs
update
command
)
.
By
an
update
,
all
the
changes
made
to
the
files
are
reflected
in
the
local
copy
.
Get
reports
.
Source
control
tools
provide
a
host
of
commands
to
provide
dif-
ferent
reports
on
the
evolution
of
the
files
.
These
include
reports
like
the
difference
between
the
local
file
and
the
latest
version
of
the
file
,
all
changes
made
to
a
file
along
with
the
dates
and
reasons
for
change
(
which
are
typ-
ically
provided
while
committing
a
change
)
.
Note
that
once
the
changes
are
committed
,
they
become
available
to
all
members
of
the
team
,
who
are
supposed
to
use
the
source
files
from
the
reposi-
tory
.
Hence
,
it
is
essential
that
a
programmer
commits
a
source
file
only
when
it
is
in
a
state
that
is
usable
by
others
.
The
normal
behavior
of
a
project
member
will
be
as
follows
:
check
out
the
latest
version
of
the
files
to
be
changed
;
make
the
planned
changes
to
them
;
validate
that
the
changes
have
the
desired
effect
(
for
which
all
the
files
may
be
copied
and
the
system
tried
out
locally
)
;
commit
the
changes
back
to
the
repository
.
It
should
be
clear
that
if
two
people
check
out
some
file
and
then
make
changes
,
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
conflict—different
changes
are
made
to
the
same
parts
of
the
file
.
All
tools
will
detect
the
conflict
when
the
second
person
tries
to
commit
the
changes
,
and
will
inform
the
user
.
The
user
has
to
manually
resolve
the
conflit
,
i.e.
,
make
the
file
such
that
the
changes
do
not
conflict
with
existing
changes
,
and
then
commit
the
file
.
Conflicts
are
usually
rare
as
they
occur
only
if
different
changes
are
made
to
the
same
lines
in
a
file
.
With
a
source
code
control
system
,
a
programmer
does
not
need
to
maintain
all
the
versions—at
any
time
if
some
changes
need
to
be
undone
,
older
versions
can
be
easily
recovered
.
The
repositories
are
always
backed
up
,
so
they
also
provide
protection
against
accidental
loss
.
Furthermore
,
a
record
of
changes
is
maintained—who
made
the
change
and
when
,
why
was
the
change
made
,
what
were
the
actual
changes
,
etc
.
Most
importantly
,
the
repository
provides
a
central
place
for
the
latest
and
authoritative
files
of
the
project
.
This
is
invaluable
for
products
that
have
a
long
life
and
that
evolve
over
many
years
.
Besides
using
the
repository
for
maintaining
the
different
versions
,
it
is
also
used
for
constructing
the
software
system
from
the
sources—an
activity
often
called
build
.
The
build
gets
the
latest
version
(
or
the
desired
version
number
)
of
the
sources
from
the
repository
,
and
creates
the
executables
from
the
sources
.
Building
the
final
executables
from
the
source
files
is
often
done
through
tools
like
the
Makefile
[
34
]
,
which
specify
the
dependence
between
files
and
how
the
final
executables
are
constructed
from
the
source
files
.
These
tools
are
capable
of
recognizing
that
files
have
changed
and
will
recompile
whenever
files
are
changed
for
creating
the
executables
.
With
source
code
control
,
these
tools
will
generally
get
the
latest
copy
from
the
repository
,
then
use
it
for
creating
What
we
discussed
here
is
one
of
the
simplest
approaches
to
source
code
control
and
build
.
Often
,
when
large
systems
are
being
built
,
more
elaborate
methods
for
source
code
control
may
be
needed
.
We
have
seen
that
coding
often
involves
making
changes
to
some
existing
code
.
Code
also
changes
when
requirements
change
or
when
new
functionality
is
added
.
Due
to
the
changes
being
done
to
modules
,
even
if
we
started
with
a
good
design
,
with
time
we
often
end
up
with
code
whose
design
is
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
.
And
once
the
design
embodied
in
the
code
becomes
complex
,
then
enhancing
the
code
to
accommodate
required
changes
becomes
more
complex
,
time
consuming
,
and
error
prone
.
In
other
words
,
the
productivity
and
quality
start
decreasing
.
Refactoring
is
the
technique
to
improve
existing
code
and
prevent
this
design
decay
with
time
.
Refactoring
is
part
of
coding
in
that
it
is
performed
during
the
coding
activity
,
but
is
not
regular
coding
.
Refactoring
has
been
practiced
in
the
past
by
programmers
,
but
recently
it
has
taken
a
more
concrete
shape
,
and
has
been
proposed
as
a
key
step
in
the
XP
practice
[
7
]
.
Refactoring
also
plays
an
important
role
in
test-driven
development—code
improvement
step
in
the
TDD
process
is
really
doing
refactoring
.
Here
we
discuss
some
key
concepts
and
some
methods
for
doing
refactoring
[
36
]
.
More
details
are
available
on
Refactoring
is
defined
as
a
change
made
to
the
internal
structure
of
software
to
make
it
easier
to
understand
and
cheaper
to
modify
without
changing
its
observable
behavior
[
36
]
.
A
key
point
here
is
that
the
change
is
being
made
to
the
design
embodied
in
the
source
code
(
i.e.
,
the
internal
structure
)
exclusively
for
improvement
purposes
.
The
basic
objective
of
refactoring
is
to
improve
the
design
.
However
,
note
that
this
is
not
about
improving
a
design
during
the
design
stages
for
creating
a
design
which
is
to
be
later
implemented
(
which
is
the
focus
of
design
method-
ologies
)
,
but
about
improving
the
design
of
code
that
already
exists
.
In
other
words
,
refactoring
,
though
done
on
source
code
,
has
the
objective
of
improving
the
design
that
the
code
implements
.
Therefore
,
the
basic
principles
of
design
guide
the
refactoring
process
.
Consequently
,
a
refactoring
generally
results
in
one
or
more
of
the
following
:
Refactoring
involves
changing
the
code
to
improve
one
of
the
design
proper-
ties
,
while
keeping
the
external
behavior
the
same
.
Refactoring
is
often
triggered
by
some
coding
changes
that
have
to
be
done
.
If
some
enhancements
are
to
be
made
to
the
existing
code
,
and
it
is
felt
that
if
the
code
structure
was
different
(
better
)
then
the
change
could
have
been
done
easier
,
that
is
the
time
to
do
refactoring
to
improve
the
code
structure
.
Even
though
refactoring
is
triggered
by
the
need
to
change
the
software
(
and
its
external
behavior
)
,
it
should
not
be
confused
or
mixed
with
the
changes
for
enhancements
.
It
is
best
to
keep
these
two
types
of
changes
separate
.
So
,
while
developing
code
,
if
refactoring
is
needed
,
the
programmer
should
cease
to
write
new
functionality
,
and
first
do
the
refactoring
,
and
then
add
new
code
.
The
main
risk
of
refactoring
is
that
existing
working
code
may
“
break
”
due
to
the
changes
being
made
.
This
is
the
main
reason
why
often
refactoring
is
not
done
.
(
The
other
reason
is
that
it
may
be
viewed
as
an
additional
and
unnecessary
cost
.
)
To
mitigate
this
risk
,
the
two
golden
rules
are
:
Have
test
scripts
available
to
test
existing
functionality
If
a
good
test
suite
is
available
,
then
whether
refactoring
preserves
existing
functionality
can
be
checked
easily
.
Refactoring
can
not
be
done
effectively
with-
out
an
automated
test
suite
as
without
such
a
suite
determining
if
the
external
behavior
has
changed
or
not
will
become
a
costly
affair
.
By
doing
refactoring
in
a
series
of
small
steps
,
and
testing
after
each
step
,
mistakes
in
refactoring
can
be
easily
identified
and
rectified
.
With
this
,
each
refactoring
makes
only
a
small
change
,
but
a
series
of
refactorings
can
significantly
transform
the
program
structure
.
With
refactoring
,
code
becomes
continuously
improving
.
That
is
,
the
design
,
rather
than
decaying
with
time
,
evolves
and
improves
with
time
.
With
refac-
toring
,
the
quality
of
the
design
improves
,
making
it
easier
to
make
changes
to
the
code
as
well
as
find
bugs
.
The
extra
cost
of
refactoring
is
paid
for
by
the
savings
achieved
later
in
reduced
testing
and
debugging
costs
,
higher
quality
,
and
reduced
effort
in
making
changes
.
If
refactoring
is
to
be
practiced
,
its
usage
can
also
ease
the
design
task
in
the
design
stages
.
Often
the
designers
spend
considerable
effort
in
trying
to
make
the
design
as
good
as
possible
,
try
to
think
of
future
changes
,
and
try
to
make
the
design
flexible
enough
to
accommodate
all
types
of
future
changes
they
can
envisage
.
This
makes
the
design
activity
very
complex
,
and
often
results
in
complex
designs
.
With
refactoring
,
the
designer
does
not
have
to
be
terribly
worried
about
making
the
best
or
most
flexible
design—the
goal
is
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
good
and
simple
design
.
And
later
if
new
changes
are
required
that
were
not
thought
of
before
,
or
if
shortcomings
are
found
in
the
design
,
the
design
is
changed
through
refactoring
.
More
often
than
not
,
the
extra
flexibility
envisaged
and
designed
is
never
needed
,
resulting
in
a
system
that
is
unduly
complex
.
Note
that
refactoring
is
not
a
technique
for
bug
fixing
or
for
improving
code
that
is
in
very
bad
shape
.
It
is
done
to
code
that
is
mostly
working—the
basic
purpose
is
to
make
the
code
live
longer
by
making
its
structure
healthier
.
It
starts
with
healthy
code
and
instead
of
letting
it
become
weak
,
it
continues
to
keep
it
healthy
.
When
is
refactoring
needed
?
There
are
some
easy-to-spot
signs
in
the
code
,
which
are
sometimes
called
“
bad
smells
”
[
36
]
,
that
often
indicate
that
some
of
the
desirable
design
properties
may
be
getting
violated
or
that
there
is
potential
of
improving
the
design
.
In
other
words
,
if
you
“
smell
”
one
of
these
“
bad
smells
,
”
it
may
be
a
sign
that
refactoring
is
needed
.
Some
of
these
bad
smells
from
[
36
]
are
given
here
.
Duplicate
Code
.
This
is
quite
common
.
One
reason
for
this
is
that
some
small
functionality
is
being
executed
at
multiple
places
(
e.g.
,
the
age
from
date
of
birth
may
be
computed
in
each
place
that
needs
the
date
)
.
Another
common
reason
is
that
when
there
are
multiple
subclasses
of
a
class
,
then
each
subclass
may
end
up
doing
a
similar
thing
.
Duplicate
code
means
that
if
this
logic
or
function
has
to
be
changed
,
it
will
have
to
be
changed
in
all
the
places
it
exists
,
making
changes
much
harder
and
costlier
.
Long
Method
.
If
a
method
is
large
,
it
often
represents
the
situation
where
it
is
trying
to
do
too
many
things
and
therefore
is
not
cohesive
.
Long
Class
.
Similarly
,
a
large
class
may
indicate
that
it
is
encapsulating
multiple
concepts
,
making
the
class
not
cohesive
.
Long
Parameter
List
.
Complex
interfaces
are
clearly
not
desirable—they
make
the
code
harder
to
understand
.
Often
,
the
complexity
is
not
intrinsic
but
a
sign
of
improper
design
.
Switch
Statements
.
In
object-oriented
programs
,
if
the
polymorphism
is
not
being
used
properly
,
it
is
likely
to
result
in
a
switch
statement
everywhere
the
behavior
is
to
be
different
depending
on
the
property
.
Presence
of
simi-
lar
switch
statements
in
different
places
is
a
sign
that
instead
of
using
class
hierarchy
,
switch
statement
is
being
used
.
Presence
of
switch
statement
makes
it
much
harder
to
extend
code—if
a
new
category
is
to
be
added
,
all
the
switch
statements
will
have
to
be
modified
.
Speculative
Generality
.
Some
class
hierarchies
may
exist
because
the
objects
in
subclasses
seem
to
be
different
.
However
,
if
the
behavior
of
objects
of
the
different
subclasses
is
the
same
,
and
there
is
no
immediate
reason
to
think
that
behaviors
might
change
,
then
it
is
a
case
of
unnecessary
complexity
.
Too
Much
Communication
Between
Objects
.
If
methods
in
one
class
are
making
many
calls
to
methods
of
another
object
to
find
out
about
its
state
,
this
is
a
sign
of
strong
coupling
.
It
is
possible
that
this
may
be
unnecessary
and
hence
such
situations
should
be
examined
for
refactoring
.
Message
Chaining
.
One
method
calls
another
method
,
which
simply
passes
this
call
to
another
object
,
and
so
on
.
This
chain
potentially
results
in
unnecessary
coupling
.
These
bad
smells
in
general
are
indicative
of
a
poor
design
.
Clearly
there
are
unlimited
possibilities
of
how
code
can
be
refactored
to
improve
its
design
.
There
are
,
however
,
some
“
standard
”
refactorings
that
can
be
applied
in
many
of
the
situations
.
For
a
catalog
of
common
refactorings
,
and
steps
for
performing
each
of
them
,
the

is
referred
to

.
Once
a
programmer
has
written
the
code
for
a
module
,
it
has
to
be
verified
before
it
is
used
by
others
.
Testing
remains
the
most
common
method
of
this
verification
.
At
the
programmer
level
the
testing
done
for
checking
the
code
the
programmer
has
developed
(
as
compared
to
checking
the
entire
software
system
)
is
called
unit
testing
.
Unit
testing
is
like
regular
testing
where
programs
are
executed
with
some
test
cases
except
that
the
focus
is
on
testing
smaller
programs
or
modules
which
are
typically
assigned
to
one
programmer
(
or
a
pair
)
for
coding
.
In
the
programming
processes
we
discussed
earlier
,
the
testing
was
essentially
unit
testing
.
A
unit
may
be
a
function
or
a
small
collection
of
functions
for
proce-
dural
languages
,
or
a
class
or
a
small
collection
of
classes
for
object-oriented
languages
.
Testing
of
modules
or
software
systems
is
a
difficult
and
challenging
task
.
Selection
of
test
cases
is
a
key
issue
in
any
form
of
testing
.
We
will
discuss
the
problem
of
test
case
selection
in
detail
in
the
next
chapter
when
we
discuss
testing
.
For
now
,
it
suffices
that
during
unit
testing
the
tester
,
who
is
generally
the
programmer
,
will
execute
the
unit
with
a
variety
of
test
cases
and
study
the
actual
behavior
of
the
units
being
tested
for
these
test
cases
.
Based
on
the
behavior
,
the
tester
decides
whether
the
unit
is
working
correctly
or
not
.
If
the
behavior
is
not
as
expected
for
some
test
case
,
then
the
programmer
finds
the
defect
in
the
program
(
an
activity
called
debugging
)
,
and
fixes
it
.
After
removing
the
defect
,
the
programmer
will
generally
execute
the
test
case
that
caused
the
unit
to
fail
again
to
ensure
that
the
fixing
has
indeed
made
the
unit
behave
correctly
.
An
issue
with
unit
testing
is
that
as
the
unit
being
tested
is
not
a
com-
plete
system
but
just
a
part
,
it
is
not
executable
by
itself
.
Furthermore
,
in
its
execution
it
may
use
other
modules
that
have
not
been
developed
yet
.
Due
to
this
,
unit
testing
often
requires
drivers
or
stubs
to
be
written
.
Drivers
play
the
role
of
the
“
calling
”
module
and
are
often
responsible
for
getting
the
test
data
,
executing
the
unit
with
the
test
data
,
and
then
reporting
the
result
.
Stubs
are
essentially
“
dummy
”
modules
that
are
used
in
place
of
the
actual
module
to
facilitate
unit
testing
.
So
,
if
a
module
M
uses
services
from
another
module
N
that
has
not
yet
been
developed
,
then
for
unit
testing
M
,
some
stub
for
N
will
have
to
be
written
so
M
can
invoke
the
services
in
some
manner
on
N
so
that
unit
testing
can
proceed
.
The
need
for
stubs
can
be
avoided
,
if
coding
and
testing
proceeds
in
a
bottom-up
manner—the
modules
at
lower
levels
are
coded
and
tested
first
such
that
when
modules
at
higher
levels
of
hierarchy
are
tested
,
the
code
for
lower-level
modules
is
already
available
.
If
incremental
coding
is
practiced
,
as
discussed
above
,
then
unit
testing
needs
to
be
performed
every
time
the
programmer
adds
some
code
.
Clearly
,
it
will
be
much
more
efficient
if
instead
of
executing
the
unit
and
giving
the
inputs
manually
,
the
execution
of
test
cases
is
automated
.
Then
test
cases
can
be
executed
easily
every
time
testing
needs
to
be
done
.
Some
tools
are
available
to
facilitate
this
.
Here
we
discuss
some
approaches
for
unit
testing
using
testing
frameworks
.
In
the
previous
chapter
we
have
seen
that
when
using
procedural
units
for
modules
,
a
program
can
be
viewed
as
a
structure
chart
,
in
which
nodes
are
functions
and
edges
represent
a
calling
relationship
.
In
unit
testing
,
one
,
or
a
small
collection
,
of
these
modules
is
to
be
tested
with
a
set
of
test
cases
.
As
the
behavior
of
a
module
depends
on
the
value
of
its
parameters
as
well
as
the
overall
state
of
the
system
of
which
it
is
a
part
(
e.g.
,
states
of
global
variables
)
,
a
test
case
for
a
module
f
(
)
will
involve
setting
both
the
state
of
the
system
on
which
the
behavior
of
f
(
)
depends
as
well
as
the
value
of
parameters
.
The
actual
values
and
the
state
of
the
system
for
a
test
case
depend
on
the
purpose
for
which
the
tester
has
designed
this
test
case
.
In
addition
,
if
a
module
f
(
)
has
other
modules
below
it
in
the
structure
chart
,
that
is
,
the
module
calls
other
modules
,
say
,
g
(
)
and
h
(
)
,
then
for
executing
f
(
)
,
we
must
have
code
for
g
(
)
and
h
(
)
also
available
.
This
is
handled
in
two
ways
.
First
is
to
test
in
a
bottom-up
manner
,
i.e.
,
test
the
modules
at
the
bottom
of
the
structure
chart
first
,
and
then
move
up
.
In
this
approach
,
when
testing
f
(
)
,
the
tested
code
for
g
(
)
and
h
(
)
will
be
available
and
will
be
used
during
testing
.
The
other
approach
is
to
write
stubs
for
g
(
)
and
h
(
)
.
Stubs
are
throwaway
code
written
for
the
called
functions
only
to
facilitate
testing
of
the
caller
function
.
Often
the
stub
for
a
function
will
just
print
some
statement
,
if
no
value
is
to
be
returned
.
If
some
value
is
to
be
returned
for
the
caller
to
proceed
,
then
often
a
few
values
will
be
hard
coded
in
the
stub
,
and
then
the
caller
will
ensure
that
the
stub
is
called
with
the
values
for
which
it
has
been
coded
.
We
will
assume
that
the
former
approach
is
being
followed
,
that
is
,
for
testing
f
(
)
,
tested
code
for
g
(
)
and
h
(
)
is
already
available
.
Testing
of
a
module
f
(
)
by
a
test
case
will
then
involve
the
following
steps
:
Declare
whether
the
test
case
has
succeeded
or
failed
.
The
simplest
and
commonly
used
approach
for
executing
this
sequence
of
steps
is
to
write
a
main
(
)
program
which
executes
the
first
three
steps
,
with
the
values
being
given
as
input
by
the
tester
or
read
from
a
file
or
hard
coded
in
the
program
,
and
then
prints
out
the
important
values
.
The
programmer
then
executes
the
last
two
steps
,
namely
,
comparing
the
results
with
expected
and
deciding
whether
the
test
has
succeeded
or
failed
.
Due
to
the
need
of
programmer
intervention
for
evaluating
the
outputs
,
and
possibly
also
for
giving
inputs
,
this
approach
is
not
easy
to
scale
.
Once
a
test
case
is
designed
,
this
sequence
of
steps
remains
fixed
and
hence
is
ideal
for
complete
automation
.
In
a
testing
framework
,
often
a
test
case
will
be
declared
as
a
function
in
which
this
sequence
of
steps
is
executed
for
that
test
case
,
including
the
checking
of
the
outcome
and
declaring
the
result—this
being
done
often
with
the
help
of
assert
statements
provided
by
the
framework
.
A
test
suite
is
then
a
collection
of
these
functions
,
and
execution
of
a
test
suite
means
each
of
the
functions
is
executed
.
The
test
suite
succeeds
if
all
the
test
cases
succeed
.
If
a
test
case
fails
,
then
the
test
framework
will
decide
whether
to
continue
executing
or
stop
.
A
function
for
a
test
case
can
be
easily
defined—it
will
execute
the
sequence
of
steps
given
above
.
However
,
executing
the
module
under
test
with
the
test
cases
is
not
straightforward
as
a
suitable
executable
will
have
to
be
formed
which
can
execute
the
functions
representing
the
test
cases
and
report
the
results
about
success
or
failure
.
And
one
would
like
to
do
this
without
changing
the
module
being
tested
or
the
file
in
which
this
module
is
contained
.
If
the
source
code
files
remain
unchanged
during
unit
testing
,
then
the
integration
process
remains
unaffected
by
unit
testing
.
Otherwise
,
after
unit
testing
,
any
changes
made
to
the
files
will
have
to
be
removed
.
This
type
of
unit
testing
is
facilitated
by
testing
frameworks
.
For
a
procedural
language
like
C
,
some
common
unit
testing
frameworks
are
CuTest
,
CUnit
,
Cutest
,
Check
,
etc
.
With
these
test
frameworks
,
each
test
case
is
defined
as
a
function
.
The
function
ends
with
some
assertions
(
provided
by
the
framework
)
which
test
for
some
conditions
to
declare
whether
the
test
has
failed
or
succeeded
.
Each
function
representing
a
unit
test
is
added
to
an
array
or
a
structure
,
which
is
the
test
suite
.
Multiple
test
suites
can
also
be
created
.
Often
there
is
one
driver
function
to
which
these
suites
are
passed
and
which
then
executes
all
the
test
cases
.
In
object-oriented
programs
,
the
unit
to
be
tested
is
usually
an
object
of
a
class
.
Testing
of
objects
can
be
defined
as
the
process
of
exercising
the
routines
provided
by
an
object
with
the
goal
of
uncovering
errors
in
the
implementation
of
the
routines
or
state
of
the
object
or
both
[
78
]
.
To
test
a
class
,
the
programmer
needs
to
create
an
object
of
that
class
,
take
the
object
to
a
particular
state
,
invoke
a
method
on
it
,
and
then
check
whether
the
state
of
the
object
is
as
expected
.
This
sequence
has
to
be
executed
many
times
for
a
method
,
and
has
to
be
performed
for
all
the
methods
.
All
this
is
facilitated
if
we
use
frameworks
like
the
Junit
(
www.junit.org
)
.
Though
Junit
itself
is
for
Java
,
similar
frameworks
have
been
developed
for
other
languages
like
C++
and
C
#
.
Here
we
briefly
describe
how
Junit
can
be
used
for
testing
a
class
and
give
an
example
.
For
testing
of
a
class
CUT
(
class
under
test
)
with
Junit
,
the
tester
has
to
create
another
class
which
inherits
from
Junit
(
e.g.
,
class
CUTtest
extends
Junit
)
.
The
Junit
framework
has
to
be
imported
by
this
class
.
This
class
is
the
driver
for
testing
CUT
.
It
must
have
a
constructor
in
which
the
objects
that
are
needed
for
the
test
cases
are
created
;
a
setUp
(
)
method
which
is
typically
used
for
creating
any
objects
and
setting
up
values
before
executing
a
test
case
;
a
suite
(
)
,
and
a
main
(
)
that
executes
the
suite
(
)
using
a
TestRunner
provided
by
Junit
.
Besides
these
methods
,
all
other
methods
are
actually
test
cases
.
Most
of
these
methods
are
often
named
testxxxx
(
)
.
Such
a
method
typ-
ically
focuses
on
testing
a
method
under
some
state
(
typically
the
name
of
the
method
and/or
the
state
is
contained
in
xxx
)
.
This
method
first
sets
up
the
state
if
not
already
setup
(
by
setup
(
)
)
,
and
then
executes
the
method
to
be
tested
.
To
check
the
results
,
Junit
provides
two
special
methods
Assert-
True
(
boolean
expression
)
and
AssertFalse
(
boolean
expression
)
.
By
using
func-
tions
and
having
a
logical
expression
on
the
state
of
the
object
,
the
tester
can
test
if
the
state
is
correct
or
not
.
If
all
the
assertions
in
all
the
methods
succeed
,
then
Junit
declares
that
the
test
has
passed
.
If
any
assert
statements
fail
,
Junit
declares
that
testing
has
failed
and
specifies
the
assertion
that
has
failed
.
To
get
an
idea
of
how
it
works
,
consider
the
testing
of
a
class
Matrix.java
,
which
provides
standard
operations
on
matrices
.
The
main
attributes
of
the
class
and
the
main
methods
are
given
in
Figure
For
unit
testing
the
Matrix
class
,
clearly
we
need
to
test
standard
operations
like
creation
of
a
matrix
,
setting
of
values
,
etc
.
We
also
need
to
test
whether
the
operations
like
add
,
subtract
,
multiply
,
determinant
are
performing
as
expected
.
Each
test
case
we
want
to
execute
is
programmed
by
setting
the
values
and
then
performing
the
operation
.
The
result
of
the
operation
is
checked
through
the
assert
statements
.
For
example
,
for
testing
add
(
)
,
we
create
a
method
testAdd
(
)

//
checks
for

with

in
which
a

is
added
to

.
The
correct
result
is
stored
a
priori
in
another
matrix
.
After
addition
,
it
is
checked
if
the
result
obtained
by
performing
add
(
)
is
equal
to
the
correct
result
.
The
method
for
this
is
shown
in
Figure
The
programmer
may
want
to
perform
more
tests
for
add
(
)
,
for
which
more
test
methods
will
be
needed
.
Similarly
,
methods
are
written
for
testing
other
methods
.
Some
of
these
tests
are
also
shown
in
Figure
As
we
can
see
,
Junit
encourages
automated
testing
.
Not
only
is
the
execu-
tion
of
test
cases
automated
,
the
checking
of
the
results
is
also
automated
.
This
makes
running
tests
fully
automatic
.
By
building
testing
scripts
,
and
continu-
ously
updating
them
as
the
class
evolves
,
we
always
have
a
test
script
which
can
be
run
quickly
.
So
,
whenever
we
make
any
changes
to
the
code
,
we
can
quickly
check
if
the
past
test
cases
are
running
on
the
click
of
a
button
.
This
becomes
almost
essential
if
incremental
coding
or
test-driven
development
(
discussed
earlier
in
the
chapter
)
is
to
be
practiced

Code
inspection
is
another
technique
that
is
often
applied
at
the
unit
level
.
It
can
be
viewed
as
“
static
testing
”
in
which
defects
are
detected
in
the
code
not
by
executing
the
code
but
through
a
manual
process
.
Code
inspection
,
unlike
testing
,
is
applied
almost
entirely
at
the
unit
level
,
i.e.
,
only
program
units
are
subjected
to
inspection
.
Hence
,
we
consider
it
as
another
form
of
unit
testing
.
However
,
in
practice
,
often
both
are
employed
,
particularly
for
critical
modules
.
It
should
be
pointed
out
that
inspection
is
a
general
verification
approach
that
can
be
applied
for
detecting
defects
in
any
document
.
However
,
it
was
first
utilized
for
detecting
defects
in
the
code
,
and
code
inspections
remain
even
today
an
industry
best
practice
which
is
widely
employed
.
Inspections
have
been
found
to
help
in
improving
not
only
quality
but
also
productivity
(
see
reports
in
[
39
,
44
,
83
]
)
.
Code
inspections
were
first
proposed
by
Fagan
[
31
,
32
]
.
Now
there
are
books
on
the
topic
which
describe
in
great
detail
how
Code
inspection
is
a
review
of
code
by
a
group
of
peers
following
a
clearly
defined
process
.
The
basic
goal
of
inspections
is
to
improve
the
quality
of
code
by
finding
defects
.
Some
of
the
key
characteristics
of
inspections
are
:
Code
inspection
is
conducted
by
programmers
and
for
programmers
.
It
is
a
structured
process
with
defined
roles
for
the
participants
.
The
focus
is
on
identifying
defects
,
not
fixing
them
.
Inspection
data
is
recorded
and
used
for
monitoring
the
effectiveness
of
the
inspection
process
.
Inspections
are
performed
by
a
team
of
reviewers
(
or
inspectors
)
including
the
author
,
with
one
of
them
being
the
moderator
.
The
moderator
has
the
overall
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
review
is
done
in
a
proper
manner
and
all
steps
in
the
review
process
are
followed
.
Most
methods
for
inspections
are
similar
with
minor
variations
.
Here
we
discuss
the
inspection
process
employed
by
a
commercial
organization
[
58
]
.
The
different
stages
in
this
process
are
:
planning
,
self-review
,
group
review
meeting
,
and
rework
and
follow-up
.
These
stages
are
generally
executed
in
a
linear
order
.
We
discuss
each
of
these
phases
now
.
The
objective
of
the
planning
phase
is
to
prepare
for
inspection
.
An
inspection
team
is
formed
,
which
should
include
the
programmer
whose
code
is
to
be
reviewed
.
The
team
should
consist
of
at
least
three
people
,
though
sometimes
four-or-five
member
teams
are
also
formed
.
A
moderator
is
appointed
.
The
author
of
the
code
ensures
that
the
code
is
ready
for
inspection
and
that
the
entry
criteria
are
satisfied
.
Commonly
used
entry
criteria
are
that
the
code
compiles
correctly
and
the
available
static
analysis
tools
have
been
applied
.
The
moderator
checks
that
the
entry
criteria
are
satisfied
by
the
code
.
A
package
is
prepared
that
is
to
be
distributed
to
the
inspection
team
.
The
package
typically
consists
of
code
to
be
inspected
,
the
specifications
for
which
the
code
was
developed
,
and
the
checklist
that
should
be
used
for
inspection
.
The
package
for
review
is
given
to
the
reviewers
.
The
moderator
may
ar-
range
an
opening
meeting
,
if
needed
,
in
which
the
author
may
provide
a
brief
overview
of
the
product
and
any
special
areas
that
need
to
be
looked
at
care-
fully
.
A
checklist
that
should
be
used
during
the
inspection
may
be
prepared
(
or
some
ready
checklist
may
be
used
)
.
As
the
aim
of
code
inspections
is
to
improve
quality
,
in
addition
to
coding
defects
,
there
are
other
quality
issues
which
code
inspections
usually
look
for
,
like
efficiency
,
compliance
to
coding
standards
,
etc
.
The
type
of
defects
the
code
inspection
should
focus
on
is
contained
in
a
checklist
that
is
provided
to
the
inspectors
.
In
this
phase
,
each
reviewer
does
a
self-review
of
the
code
.
During
the
self-
review
,
a
reviewer
goes
through
the
entire
code
and
logs
all
the
potential
defects
he
or
she
finds
in
the
self-preparation
log
.
Often
the
reviewers
will
mark
the
defect
on
the
work
product
itself
,
and
may
provide
a
summary
of
the
self-review
in
the
log
.
The
reviewers
also
record
the
time
they
spent
in
the
self-review
.
A
standard
form
may
be
used
for
the
self-preparation
log
;
an
example
form
is
shown
in
Figure
[
58
]
.
Ideally
,
the
self-review
should
be
done
in
one
continuous
time
span
.
The
recommended
time
is
less
than
two
hours—that
is
,
the
work
product
is
small
enough
that
it
can
be
fully
examined
in
less
than
two
hours
.
This
phase
of
the
review
process
ends
when
all
reviewers
have
properly
performed
their
self-
review
and
filled
the
self-review
logs
.
The
basic
purpose
of
the
group
review
meeting
is
to
come
up
with
the
final
defect
list
,
based
on
the
initial
list
of
defects
reported
by
the
reviewers
and
the
new
ones
found
during
the
discussion
in
the
meeting
.
The
entry
criterion
for
this
step
is
that
the
moderator
is
satisfied
that
all
the
reviewers
are
ready
for
the
meeting
.
The
main
outputs
of
this
phase
are
the
defect
log
and
the
defect
summary
report
.
The
moderator
first
checks
to
see
if
all
the
reviewers
are
prepared
.
This
is
done
by
a
brief
examination
of
the
effort
and
defect
data
in
the
self-review
logs
to
confirm
that
sufficient
time
and
attention
has
gone
into
the
prepara-
tion
.
When
preparation
is
not
adequate
,
the
group
review
is
deferred
until
all
participants
are
fully
prepared
.
If
everything
is
ready
,
the
group
review
meeting
is
held
.
The
moderator
is
in
charge
of
the
meeting
and
has
to
make
sure
that
the
meeting
stays
focused
on
its
basic
purpose
of
defect
identification
and
does
not
degenerate
into
a
general
brainstorming
session
or
personal
attacks
on
the
author
.
The
meeting
is
conducted
as
follows
.
A
team
member
(
called
the
reader
)
goes
over
the
code
line
by
line
(
or
any
other
convenient
small
unit
)
,
and
para-
phrases
each
line
to
the
team
.
Sometimes
no
paraphrasing
is
done
and
the
team
just
goes
over
the
code
line
by
line
.
At
any
line
,
if
any
reviewer
has
any
issue
from
before
,
or
finds
any
new
issue
in
the
meeting
while
listening
to
others
,
the
reviewer
raises
the
issue
.
There
could
be
a
discussion
on
the
issue
raised
.
The
author
accepts
the
issue
as
a
defect
or
clarifies
why
it
is
not
a
defect
.
After
discussion
an
agreement
is
reached
and
one
member
of
the
review
team
(
called
the
scribe
)
records
the
identified
defects
in
the
defect
log
.
At
the
end
of
the
meeting
,
the
scribe
reads
out
the
defects
recorded
in
the
defect
log
for
a
final
review
by
the
team
members
.
Note
that
during
the
entire
process
of
review
,
defects
are
only
identified
.
It
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
group
to
identify
solutions—that
is
done
later
by
the
author
.
The
final
defect
log
is
the
official
record
of
the
defects
identified
in
the
inspection
and
may
also
be
used
to
track
the
defects
to
closure
.
For
analyzing
the
effectiveness
of
an
inspection
,
however
,
only
summary-level
information
is
needed
,
for
which
a
summary
report
is
prepared
.
The
summary
report
describes
the
code
,
the
total
effort
spent
and
its
breakup
in
the
different
review
process
activities
,
total
number
of
defects
found
for
each
category
,
and
size
.
If
types
of
defects
were
also
recorded
,
then
the
number
of
defects
in
each
category
can
also
be
recorded
in
the
summary
.
A
partially
filled
summary
report
is
shown
in
Figure
[
58
]
.
The
summary
report
is
self-explanatory
.
Total
number
of
minor
defects
found
was
8
,
and
the
total
number
of
major
defects
found
was
3
.
That
is
,
the
defect
density
found
is
8/0.250
=
3
,
and
3/0.25
=
1
.
From
experience
,
both
of
these
rates
are
within
the
range
seen
in
the
past
;
hence
it
can
be
assumed
that
the
review
was
conducted
properly
.
The
review
team
had
,
and
each
had
spent
about
1
..
This
means
that
the
preparation
rate
was
about
180
LOC
per
hour
,
and
the
group
review
rate
was
250
LOC
per
hour
,
both
of
which
,
from
past
experience
,
also
seem
acceptable
.
If
the
modifications
required
for
fixing
the
defects
and
addressing
the
is-
sues
are
few
,
then
the
group
review
status
is
“
accepted.
”
If
the
modifications
required
are
many
,
a
follow-up
meeting
by
the
moderator
or
a
re-review
might
be
necessary
to
verify
whether
the
changes
have
been
incorporated
correctly
.
The
moderator
recommends
what
is
to
be
done
.
In
addition
,
recommendations
regarding
reviews
in
the
next
stages
may
also
be
made
(
e.g.
,
in
a
detailed-
design
review
it
may
be
recommended
code
of
which
modules
should
undergo
Traditionally
,
work
on
metrics
has
focused
on
the
final
product
,
namely
,
the
code
.
In
a
sense
,
all
metrics
for
intermediate
products
of
requirements
and
design
are
basically
used
to
ensure
that
the
final
product
has
a
high
quality
and
the
productivity
of
the
project
stays
high
.
That
is
,
the
basic
goal
of
metrics
for
intermediate
products
is
to
predict
or
get
some
idea
about
the
metrics
of
the
final
product
.
For
the
code
,
the
most
commonly
used
metrics
are
size
and
complexity
.
Here
we
discuss
a
few
size
and
complexity
measures
.
Size
of
a
product
is
a
simple
measure
,
which
can
be
easy
to
calculate
.
The
main
reason
for
interest
in
size
measures
is
that
size
is
the
major
factor
that
affects
the
cost
of
a
project
.
Size
in
itself
is
of
little
use
;
it
is
the
relationship
of
size
with
the
cost
and
quality
that
makes
size
an
important
metric
.
It
is
also
used
to
measure
productivity
during
the
project
(
e.g.
,
KLOC
per
person-month
)
.
Final
quality
delivered
by
a
process
is
also
frequently
normalized
with
respect
to
size
(
number
of
defects
per
KLOC
)
.
For
these
reasons
,
size
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
frequently
used
metrics
.
The
most
common
measure
of
size
is
delivered
lines
of
source
code
,
or
the
number
of
lines
of
code
(
LOC
)
finally
delivered
.
The
trouble
with
LOC
is
that
the
number
of
lines
of
code
for
a
project
depends
heavily
on
the
language
used
.
For
example
,
a
program
written
in
assembly
language
will
be
large
compared
to
the
same
program
written
in
a
higher-level
language
,
if
LOC
is
used
as
a
size
measure
.
Even
for
the
same
language
,
the
size
can
vary
considerably
depending
on
how
lines
are
counted
.
Despite
these
deficiencies
,
LOC
remains
a
handy
and
reasonable
size
measure
that
is
used
extensively
.
Currently
,
perhaps
the
most
widely
used
counting
method
for
determining
the
size
is
to
count
noncomment
,
nonblank
lines
only
.
Halstead
[
46
]
has
proposed
metrics
for
length
and
volume
of
a
program
based
on
the
number
of
operators
and
operands
.
In
a
program
we
define
the
following
measurable
quantities
:
f1
,
j
is
the
number
of
occurrences
of
the
jth
most
frequent
operator
f2
,
j
is
the
number
of
occurrences
of
the
jth
most
frequent
operand
Then
the
vocabulary
n
of
a
program
is
defined
as
With
the
measurable
parameters
listed
earlier
,
two
new
parameters
are
defined
:
From
the
length
and
the
vocabulary
,
the
volume
V
of
the
program
is
defined
as
This
definition
of
the
volume
of
a
program
represents
the
minimum
number
of
bits
necessary
to
represent
the
program
.
log2
(
n
)
is
the
number
of
bits
needed
to
represent
every
element
in
the
program
uniquely
,
and
N
is
the
total
occur-
rences
of
the
different
elements
.
Volume
is
used
as
a
size
metric
for
a
program
.
Experiments
have
shown
that
the
volume
of
a
program
is
highly
correlated
with
the
size
in
LOC
.
The
productivity
,
if
measured
only
in
terms
of
lines
of
code
per
unit
time
,
can
vary
a
lot
depending
on
the
complexity
of
the
system
to
be
developed
.
Clearly
,
a
programmer
will
produce
a
lesser
amount
of
code
for
highly
complex
system
programs
,
as
compared
to
a
simple
application
program
.
Similarly
,
complexity
has
great
impact
on
the
cost
of
maintaining
a
program
.
To
quantify
complexity
beyond
the
fuzzy
notion
of
the
ease
with
which
a
program
can
be
constructed
or
comprehended
,
some
metrics
to
measure
the
complexity
of
a
program
are
needed
.
A
number
of
metrics
have
been
proposed
for
quantifying
the
complexity
of
a
program
[
47
]
,
and
studies
have
been
done
to
correlate
the
complexity
with
maintenance
effort
.
Here
we
discuss
a
few
of
the
complexity
measures
that
have
been
proposed
.
Cyclomatic
Complexity
Based
on
the
capability
of
the
human
mind
and
the
experience
of
people
,
it
is
generally
recognized
that
conditions
and
control
statements
add
complexity
to
a
program
.
Given
two
programs
with
the
same
size
,
the
program
with
the
larger
number
of
decision
statements
is
likely
to
be
more
complex
.
The
simplest
measure
of
complexity
,
then
,
is
the
number
of
constructs
that
represent
branches
in
the
control
flow
of
the
program
,
like
if
then
else
,
while
do
,
repeat
until
,
and
goto
statements
.
A
more
refined
measure
is
the
cyclomatic
complexity
measure
proposed
by
McCabe
,
which
is
a
graph-theoretic–based
concept
.
For
a
graph
G
with
n
nodes
,
e
edges
,
and
p
connected
components
,
the
cyclomatic
number
V
(
G
)
is
defined
as
To
use
this
to
define
the
cyclomatic
complexity
of
a
module
,
the
control
flow
graph
G
of
the
module
is
first
drawn
.
To
construct
a
control
flow
graph
of
a
program
module
,
break
the
module
into
blocks
delimited
by
statements
that
affect
the
control
flow
,
like
if
,
while
,
repeat
,
and
goto
.
These
blocks
form
the
nodes
of
the
graph
.
If
the
control
from
a
block
i
can
branch
to
a
block
j
,
then
draw
an
arc
from
node
i
to
node
j
in
the
graph
.
The
control
flow
of
a
program
can
be
constructed
mechanically
.
As
an
example
,
consider
the
C-like
function
for
bubble
sorting
,
given
next
.
The
control
flow
graph
for
this
is
given
in
Figure
The
graph
of
a
module
has
an
entry
node
and
an
exit
node
,
corresponding
to
the
first
and
last
blocks
of
statements
(
or
we
can
create
artificial
nodes
for
simplicity
,
as
in
the
example
)
.
In
such
graphs
there
will
be
a
path
from
the
entry
node
to
any
node
and
a
path
from
any
node
to
the
exit
node
(
assuming
the
program
has
no
anomalies
like
unreachable
code
)
.
For
such
a
graph
,
the
cyclomatic
number
can
be
0
if
the
code
is
a
linear
sequence
of
statements
without
any
control
statement
.
If
we
draw
an
arc
from
the
exit
node
to
the
entry
node
,
the
graph
will
be
strongly
connected
because
there
is
a
path
between
any
two
nodes
.
The
cyclomatic
number
of
a
graph
for
any
program
will
then
be
nonzero
,
and
it
is
desirable
to
have
a
nonzero
complexity
for
a
simple
program
without
any
conditions
(
after
all
,
there
is
some
complexity
in
such
a
program
)
.
Hence
,
for
computing
the
cyclomatic
complexity
of
a
program
,
an
arc
is
added
from
the
exit
node
to
the
start
node
,
which
makes
it
a
strongly
connected
graph
.
For
a
module
,
the
cyclomatic
complexity
is
defined
to
be
the
cyclomatic
number
of
such
a
graph
for
the
module
.
As
it
turns
out
the
cyclomatic
complexity
of
a
module
(
or
cyclomatic
num-
ber
of
its
graph
)
is
equal
to
the
maximum
number
of
linearly
independent
circuits
in
the
graph
.
A
set
of
circuits
is
linearly
independent
if
no
circuit
is
totally
contained
in
another
circuit
or
is
a
combination
of
other
circuits
.
So
,
for
calculating
the
cyclomatic
number
of
a
module
,
we
can
draw
the
graph
,
make
it
connected
by
drawing
an
arc
from
the
exit
node
to
the
entry
node
,
and
then
either
count
the
number
of
circuits
or
compute
it
by
counting
the
number
of
edges
and
nodes
.
In
the
graph
shown
in
Figure
the
cyclomatic
complexity
is
ckt
1
:
b
c
e

ckt
2
:

It
can
also
be
shown
that
the
cyclomatic
complexity
of
a
module
is
the
number
of
decisions
in
the
module
plus
one
,
where
a
decision
is
effectively
any
condi-
tional
statement
in
the
module
[
26
]
.
Hence
,
we
can
also
compute
the
cyclomatic
complexity
simply
by
counting
the
number
of
decisions
in
the
module
.
For
this
example
,
as
we
can
see
,
we
get
the
same
cyclomatic
complexity
for
the
module
if
we
add
.
(
The
module
has
three
decisions
:
two
in
the
two
while
statements
and
one
in
the
if
statement
.
)
The
cyclomatic
number
is
one
quantitative
measure
of
module
complexity
.
It
can
be
extended
to
compute
the
complexity
of
the
whole
program
,
though
it
is
more
suitable
at
the
module
level
.
McCabe
proposed
that
the
cyclomatic
complexity
of
modules
should
,
in
general
,
be
kept
below
10
.
The
cyclomatic
number
can
also
be
used
as
a
number
of
paths
that
should
be
tested
during
testing
.
Cyclomatic
complexity
is
one
of
the
most
widely
used
complexity
mea-
sures
.
Experiments
indicate
that
the
cyclomatic
complexity
is
highly
correlated
to
the
size
of
the
module
in
LOC
(
after
all
,
the
more
lines
of
code
the
greater
the
number
of
decisions
)
.
It
has
also
been
found
to
be
correlated
to
the
number
of
faults
found
in
modules
.
Halstead
’
s
Measure
Halstead
also
proposed
a
number
of
other
measures
based
on
his
software
science
[
46
]
.
Some
of
these
can
be
considered
complexity
mea-
sures
.
As
given
earlier
,
a
number
of
variables
are
defined
in
software
science
.
These
are
n1
(
number
of
unique
operators
)
,
n2
(
number
of
unique
operands
)
,
N1
(
total
frequency
of
operators
)
,
and
N2
(
total
frequency
of
operands
)
.
As
any
program
must
have
at
least
two
operators—one
for
function
call
and
one
for
end
of
statement—the
ratio
n1/-
ficulty
due
to
the
larger
number
of
operators
in
the
program
.
The
ratio
N2/n
.
In
a
program
in
which
variables
are
changed
more
frequently
,
this
ratio
will
be
larger
.
As
such
programs
are
harder
to
understand
,
ease
of
reading
or
writing
is
defined
as
Halstead
’
s
complexity
measure
focused
on
the
internal
complexity
of
a
module
,
as
does
McCabe
’
s
complexity
measure
.
Thus
,
the
complexity
of
the
module
’
s
connection
with
its
environment
is
not
given
much
importance
.
In
Halstead
’
s
measure
,
a
module
’
s
connection
with
its
environment
is
reflected
in
terms
of
operands
and
operators
.
A
call
to
another
module
is
considered
an
operator
,
and
all
the
parameters
are
considered
operands
of
this
operator
.
Live
Variables
In
a
computer
program
,
a
typical
assignment
statement
uses
and
modifies
only
a
few
variables
.
However
,
in
general
the
statements
have
a
much
larger
context
.
That
is
,
to
construct
or
understand
a
statement
,
a
programmer
must
keep
track
of
a
number
of
variables
,
other
than
those
directly
used
in
the
statement
.
For
a
statement
,
such
data
items
are
called
live
variables
.
Intuitively
,
the
more
live
variables
for
statements
,
the
harder
it
will
be
to
understand
a
program
.
Hence
,
the
concept
of
live
variables
can
be
used
as
a
metric
for
program
complexity
.
First
let
us
define
live
variables
more
precisely
.
A
variable
is
considered
live
from
its
first
to
its
last
reference
within
a
module
,
including
all
statements
between
the
first
and
last
statement
where
the
variable
is
referenced
.
Using
this
definition
,
the
set
of
live
variables
for
each
statement
can
be
computed
easily
by
analysis
of
the
module
’
s
code
.
The
procedure
of
determining
the
live
variables
can
easily
be
automated
.
For
a
statement
,
the
number
of
live
variables
represents
the
degree
of
dif-
ficulty
of
the
statement
.
This
notion
can
be
extended
to
the
entire
module
by
defining
the
average
number
of
live
variables
.
The
average
number
of
live
vari-
ables
is
the
sum
of
the
count
of
live
variables
(
for
all
executable
statements
)
divided
by
the
number
of
executable
statements
.
This
is
a
complexity
measure
for
the
module
.
Live
variables
are
defined
from
the
point
of
view
of
data
usage
.
The
logic
of
a
module
is
not
explicitly
included
.
The
logic
is
used
only
to
determine
the
first
and
last
statement
of
reference
for
a
variable
.
Hence
,
this
concept
of
complexity
is
quite
different
from
cyclomatic
complexity
,
which
is
based
entirely
on
the
logic
and
considers
data
as
secondary
.
Another
data
usage-oriented
concept
is
span
,
the
number
of
statements
between
two
successive
uses
of
a
variable
.
If
a
variable
is
referenced
at
n
different
places
in
a
module
,
then
for
that
variable
there
are
(
n
1
)
spans
.
The
average
span
size
is
the
average
number
of
executable
statements
between
two
successive
references
of
a
variable
.
A
large
span
implies
that
the
reader
of
the
program
has
to
remember
a
definition
of
a
variable
for
a
larger
period
of
time
(
or
for
more
statements
)
.
In
other
words
,
span
can
be
considered
a
complexity
measure
;
the
larger
the
span
,
the
more
complex
the
module
.
Knot
Count
A
method
for
quantifying
complexity
based
on
the
locations
of
the
control
transfers
of
the
program
has
been
proposed
in
[
85
]
.
It
was
designed
largely
for
FORTRAN
programs
,
where
explicit
transfer
of
control
is
shown
by
the
use
of
goto
statements
.
A
programmer
,
to
understand
a
given
program
,
typically
draws
arrows
from
the
point
of
control
transfer
to
its
destination
,
helping
to
create
a
mental
picture
of
the
program
and
the
control
transfers
in
it
.
According
to
this
metric
,
the
more
intertwined
these
arrows
become
,
the
more
complex
the
program
.
This
notion
is
captured
in
the
concept
of
a
“
knot.
”
A
knot
is
essentially
the
intersection
of
two
such
control
transfer
arrows
.
If
each
statement
in
the
program
is
written
on
a
separate
line
,
this
notion
can
be
formalized
as
follows
.
A
jump
from
line
a
to
line
b
is
represented
by
the
pair
(
a
,
b
)
.
Two
jumps
(
a
,
b
)
and
(
p
,
q
)
give
rise
to
a
knot
if
either
min
(
a
,
b
)
<
min
(
p
,
q
)
<
max
(
a
,
b
)
and
max
(
p
,
q
)
>
max
(
a
,
b
)
;
or
min
(
a
,
b
)
<
max
(
p
,
Problems
can
arise
while
determining
the
knot
count
of
programs
using
structured
constructs
.
One
method
is
to
convert
such
a
program
into
one
that
explicitly
shows
control
transfers
and
then
compute
the
knot
count
.
The
basic
scheme
can
be
generalized
to
flow
graphs
,
though
with
flow
graphs
only
bounds
can
be
obtained
.
Topological
Complexity
A
complexity
measure
that
is
sensitive
to
the
nesting
of
structures
has
been
proposed
in
[
20
]
.
Like
cyclomatic
complexity
,
it
is
based
on
the
flow
graph
of
a
module
or
program
.
The
complexity
of
a
program
is
considered
its
maximal
intersect
number
min
.
To
compute
the
maximal
intersect
,
a
flow
graph
is
converted
into
a
strongly
connected
graph
(
by
drawing
an
arrow
from
the
terminal
node
to
the
initial
node
)
.
A
strongly
connected
graph
divides
the
graph
into
a
finite
number
of
regions
.
The
number
of
regions
is
(
edges
nodes
+
2
)
.
If
we
draw
a
line
that
enters
each
region
exactly
once
,
then
the
number
of
times
this
line
intersects
the
arcs
in
the
graph
is
the
maximal
intersect
min
,
which
is
taken
to
be
the
complexity
of
the
program
.
As
reading
programs
is
a
much
more
common
activity
than
writing
programs
,
the
goal
of
the
coding
activity
is
to
produce
programs
that
are
,
besides
being
free
of
defects
,
easy
to
understand
and
modify
.
Use
of
structured
programming
in
which
the
program
is
a
sequence
of
suitable
single-entry
single-exit
constructs
makes
programs
easy
to
understand
and
verify
.
Other
practices
like
using
information
hiding
,
suitable
coding
stan-
dards
,
and
good
programming
practices
also
help
improve
code
readability
and
quality
.
For
a
developer
,
it
is
most
effective
to
develop
code
incrementally
.
This
can
be
done
by
writing
code
in
small
increments
,
and
testing
and
debugging
each
increment
before
writing
more
code
.
Alternatively
,
test-driven
development
may
be
followed
in
which
test
cases
are
written
first
and
then
code
is
written
to
pass
these
test
cases
.
Though
coding
of
a
module
is
generally
done
by
individual
programmers
,
an
alternative
is
pair
programming
,
in
which
coding
is
done
by
a
pair
of
programmers—both
together
evolving
strategies
,
data
structures
,
algorithms
etc
.
Evolving
code
needs
to
be
properly
managed
.
This
can
be
done
through
proper
source
code
control
tools
which
allow
easy
management
of
the
different
versions
that
get
created
,
as
well
as
easy
undoing
of
changes
that
need
to
be
rolled
back
.
As
code
changes
with
time
,
to
ensure
that
the
code
quality
does
not
continue
to
degrade
due
to
evolution
,
refactoring
may
be
done
.
During
refactoring
no
new
functionality
is
added—only
improvement
is
done
so
that
the
design
of
the
code
improves
by
reduction
of
coupling
,
increase
in
cohesion
,
and
better
use
of
hierarchies
.
Unit
testing
is
a
very
popular
and
most
often
used
practice
by
programmers
for
verifying
the
code
they
have
written
.
In
unit
testing
,
the
programmer
tests
his/her
code
in
isolation
.
For
procedural
languages
this
is
often
a
small
set
of
procedures
or
functions
,
and
for
object-oriented
languages
this
is
generally
a
class
or
a
small
set
of
classes
.
Unit
testing
requires
drivers
and
stubs
,
and
can
be
facilitated
by
the
use
of
frameworks
which
allow
automated
test
script
execution
.
Good
frameworks
like
CUnit
and
Junit
exist
for
both
procedural
languages
and
object-oriented
languages
.
A
number
of
metrics
exist
for
quantifying
different
qualities
of
code
.
The
most
commonly
used
are
size
metrics
,
because
they
are
used
to
assess
the
produc-
tivity
of
people
and
are
often
used
in
cost
estimation
.
The
most
common
size
measure
is
lines
of
code
(
LOC
)
,
which
is
also
used
in
most
cost
models
.
The
goal
of
complexity
metrics
is
to
quantify
the
complexity
of
software
,
as
com-
plexity
is
an
important
factor
affecting
the
productivity
of
projects
and
is
a
factor
in
cost
estimation
.
A
number
of
different
metrics
exist
,
most
common
being
the
cyclomatic
complexity
,
which
is
based
on
the
internal
logic
of
the
program
and
defines
complexity
as
the
number
of
independent
cycles
in
the
flow
graph
of
the
program
.

In
a
software
development
project
,
errors
can
be
introduced
at
any
stage
dur-
ing
development
.
Though
errors
are
detected
after
each
phase
by
techniques
like
inspections
,
some
errors
remain
undetected
.
Ultimately
,
these
remaining
errors
are
reflected
in
the
code
.
Hence
,
the
final
code
is
likely
to
have
some
re-
quirements
errors
and
design
errors
,
in
addition
to
errors
introduced
during
the
coding
activity
.
To
ensure
quality
of
the
final
delivered
software
,
these
defects
will
have
to
be
removed
.
There
are
two
types
of
approaches
for
identifying
defects
in
the
software—
static
and
dynamic
.
In
static
analysis
,
the
code
is
not
executed
but
is
evaluated
through
some
process
or
some
tools
for
locating
defects
.
Code
inspections
,
which
we
discussed
in
the
previous
chapter
,
is
one
static
approach
.
Another
is
static
analysis
of
code
through
the
use
of
tools
.
In
dynamic
analysis
,
code
is
executed
,
and
the
execution
is
used
for
determining
defects
.
Testing
is
the
most
common
dynamic
technique
that
is
employed
.
Indeed
,
testing
is
the
most
commonly
used
technique
for
detecting
defects
,
and
performs
a
very
critical
role
for
ensuring
quality
.
During
testing
,
the
software
under
test
(
SUT
)
is
executed
with
a
finite
set
of
test
cases
,
and
the
behavior
of
the
system
for
these
test
cases
is
evaluated
to
determine
if
the
system
is
performing
as
expected
.
The
basic
purpose
of
testing
is
to
increase
the
confidence
in
the
functioning
of
SUT
.
And
as
testing
is
extremely
expensive
and
can
consume
unlimited
amount
of
effort
,
an
additional
practical
goal
is
to
achieve
the
desired
confidence
as
efficiently
as
possible
.
Clearly
,
the
effectiveness
and
efficiency
of
testing
depends
critically
on
the
test
cases
selected
.
Much
of
this
chapter
therefore
is
devoted
to
test
case
selection

In
this
section
we
will
first
define
some
of
the
terms
that
are
commonly
used
when
discussing
testing
.
Then
we
will
discuss
some
basic
issues
relating
to
how
testing
is
performed
,
and
the
importance
of
psychology
of
the
tester
.
While
discussing
testing
we
commonly
use
terms
like
error
,
fault
,
failure
etc
.
Let
us
start
by
defining
these
concepts
clearly
[
52
]
.
The
term
error
is
used
in
two
different
ways
.
It
refers
to
the
discrepancy
between
a
computed
,
observed
,
or
measured
value
and
the
true
,
specified
,
or
theoretically
correct
value
.
That
is
,
error
refers
to
the
difference
between
the
actual
output
of
a
software
and
the
correct
output
.
In
this
interpretation
,
error
is
essentially
a
measure
of
the
difference
between
the
actual
and
the
ideal
.
Error
is
also
used
to
refer
to
human
action
that
results
in
software
containing
a
defect
or
fault
.
This
definition
is
quite
general
and
encompasses
all
the
phases
.
Fault
is
a
condition
that
causes
a
system
to
fail
in
performing
its
required
function
.
A
fault
is
the
basic
reason
for
software
malfunction
and
is
practically
synonymous
with
the
commonly
used
term
bug
,
or
the
somewhat
more
general
term
defect
.
The
term
error
is
also
often
used
to
refer
to
defects
(
taking
a
variation
of
the
second
definition
of
error
)
.
In
this
book
we
will
continue
to
use
the
terms
in
the
manner
commonly
used
,
and
no
explicit
distinction
will
be
made
between
errors
and
faults
,
unless
necessary
.
Failure
is
the
inability
of
a
system
or
component
to
perform
a
required
function
according
to
its
specifications
.
A
software
failure
occurs
if
the
behavior
of
the
software
is
different
from
the
specified
behavior
.
Failures
may
be
caused
by
functional
or
performance
factors
.
Note
that
the
definition
does
not
imply
that
a
failure
must
be
observed
.
It
is
possible
that
a
failure
may
occur
but
not
be
detected
.
There
are
some
implications
of
these
definitions
.
Presence
of
an
error
(
in
the
state
)
implies
that
a
failure
must
have
occurred
,
and
the
observance
of
a
failure
implies
that
a
fault
must
be
present
in
the
system
.
However
,
the
presence
of
a
fault
does
not
imply
that
a
failure
must
occur
.
The
presence
of
a
fault
in
a
system
only
implies
that
the
fault
has
a
potential
to
cause
a
failure
.
Whether
a
fault
actually
manifests
itself
in
a
certain
time
duration
depends
on
how
the
software
is
executed
.
There
are
direct
consequences
of
this
on
testing
.
If
during
testing
we
do
not
observe
any
errors
,
we
can
not
say
anything
about
the
presence
or
absence
of
faults
in
the
system
.
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
observe
some
failure
,
we
can
say
that
there
are
some
faults
in
the
system
.
This
relationship
of
fault
and
failure
makes
the
task
of
selecting
test
cases
for
testing
very
challenging—an
objective
while
selecting
test
cases
is
to
select
those
that
will
reveal
the
defect
,
if
it
exists
.
Ideally
we
would
like
the
set
of
test
cases
to
be
such
that
if
there
are
any
defects
in
the
system
,
some
test
case
in
the
set
will
reveal
it—something
impossible
to
achieve
in
most
situations
.
It
should
be
noted
that
during
the
testing
process
,
only
failures
are
ob-
served
,
by
which
the
presence
of
faults
is
deduced
.
That
is
,
testing
only
reveals
the
presence
of
faults
.
The
actual
faults
are
identified
by
separate
activities
,
commonly
referred
to
as
“
debugging.
”
In
other
words
,
for
identifying
faults
,
af-
ter
testing
has
revealed
the
presence
of
faults
,
the
expensive
task
of
debugging
has
to
be
performed
.
This
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
testing
is
an
expensive
method
for
identification
of
faults
.
So
far
we
have
used
the
terms
test
case
or
set
of
test
cases
informally
.
Let
us
define
them
more
precisely
.
A
test
case
(
often
called
a
test
)
can
be
considered
as
comprising
a
set
of
test
inputs
and
execution
conditions
,
which
are
designed
to
exercise
the
SUT
in
a
particular
manner
[
52
]
.
Generally
,
a
test
case
also
specifies
the
expected
outcome
from
executing
the
SUT
under
the
specified
execution
conditions
and
test
inputs
.
A
group
of
related
test
cases
that
are
generally
executed
together
to
test
some
specific
behavior
or
aspect
of
the
SUT
is
often
referred
to
as
a
test
suite
.
Note
that
in
a
test
case
,
test
inputs
and
execution
conditions
are
mentioned
separately
.
Test
inputs
are
the
specific
values
of
parameters
or
other
inputs
that
are
given
to
the
SUT
either
by
the
user
or
some
other
program
.
The
execution
conditions
,
on
the
other
hand
,
reflect
the
state
of
the
system
and
environment
which
also
impact
the
behavior
of
the
SUT
.
So
,
for
example
,
while
testing
a
function
to
add
a
record
in
the
database
if
it
does
not
already
exist
,
the
behavior
of
the
function
will
depend
both
on
the
value
of
the
input
record
as
well
as
the
state
of
the
database
.
And
a
test
case
needs
to
specify
both
.
For
example
,
a
test
case
for
this
function
might
specify
a
record
r
as
input
,
and
might
specify
that
the
state
of
the
database
be
such
that
r
already
exists
in
it
.
Testing
can
be
done
manually
with
the
tester
executing
the
test
cases
in
the
test
suite
and
then
checking
if
the
behavior
is
as
specified
in
the
test
cases
.
This
is
a
very
cumbersome
process
,
particularly
when
the
test
suite
contains
a
large
number
of
test
cases
.
It
becomes
even
more
cumbersome
since
the
test
suite
often
has
to
be
executed
every
time
the
SUT
is
changed
.
Hence
,
the
current
With
automated
testing
,
a
test
case
is
typically
a
function
call
(
or
a
method
invocation
)
,
which
does
all
the
activities
of
a
test
case—it
sets
the
test
data
and
the
test
conditions
,
invokes
the
SUT
as
per
the
test
case
,
compares
the
results
returned
with
expected
results
,
and
declares
to
the
tester
whether
the
SUT
failed
or
passed
the
test
case
.
In
other
words
,
with
automated
testing
,
executing
a
test
case
essentially
means
executing
this
function
.
A
test
suite
will
then
be
a
set
of
such
functions
,
each
representing
a
test
case
.
To
test
a
SUT
with
the
test
suite
,
generally
an
automated
test
script
will
be
written
which
will
invoke
the
test
cases
in
the
desired
sequence
.
To
have
a
test
suite
executed
automatically
,
we
will
need
a
framework
in
which
test
inputs
can
be
defined
,
defined
inputs
can
be
used
by
functions
representing
test
cases
,
the
automated
test
script
can
be
written
,
the
SUT
can
be
executed
by
this
script
,
and
the
result
of
entire
testing
reported
to
the
tester
.
Many
testing
frameworks
now
exist
that
permit
all
this
to
be
done
in
a
simple
manner
.
A
testing
framework
is
also
sometimes
called
a
test
harness
.
A
test
harness
or
a
test
framework
makes
the
life
of
a
tester
simpler
by
providing
easy
means
of
defining
a
test
suite
,
executing
it
,
and
reporting
the
results
.
With
a
test
framework
,
a
test
suite
is
defined
once
,
and
then
whenever
needed
,
complete
testing
can
be
done
by
the
click
of
a
button
or
giving
a
command
.
As
mentioned
,
in
testing
,
the
software
under
test
(
SUT
)
is
executed
with
a
set
of
test
cases
.
As
discussed
,
devising
a
set
of
test
cases
that
will
guarantee
that
all
errors
will
be
detected
is
not
feasible
.
Moreover
,
there
are
no
formal
or
precise
methods
for
selecting
test
cases
.
Even
though
there
are
a
number
of
heuristics
and
rules
of
thumb
for
deciding
the
test
cases
,
selecting
test
cases
is
still
a
creative
activity
that
relies
on
the
ingenuity
of
the
tester
.
Because
of
this
,
the
psychology
of
the
person
performing
the
testing
becomes
important
.
A
basic
purpose
of
testing
is
to
detect
the
errors
that
may
be
present
in
the
program
.
Hence
,
one
should
not
start
testing
with
the
intent
of
showing
that
a
program
works
;
rather
the
intent
should
be
to
show
that
a
program
does
not
work
;
to
reveal
any
defect
that
may
exist
.
Due
to
this
,
testing
has
also
been
defined
as
the
process
of
executing
a
program
with
the
intent
of
finding
errors
This
emphasis
on
proper
intent
of
testing
is
not
a
trivial
matter
because
test
cases
are
designed
by
human
beings
,
and
human
beings
have
a
tendency
to
perform
actions
to
achieve
the
goal
they
have
in
mind
.
So
,
if
the
goal
is
to
demonstrate
that
a
program
works
,
we
may
consciously
or
subconsciously
select
test
cases
that
will
try
to
demonstrate
that
goal
and
that
will
beat
the
basic
purpose
of
testing
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
the
intent
is
to
show
that
the
program
does
not
work
,
we
will
challenge
our
intellect
to
find
test
cases
toward
that
end
,
and
we
are
likely
to
detect
more
errors
.
Testing
is
essentially
a
destructive
process
,
where
the
tester
has
to
treat
the
program
as
an
adversary
that
must
be
beaten
by
the
tester
by
showing
the
presence
of
errors
.
This
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
many
organizations
employ
independent
testing
in
which
testing
is
done
by
a
team
that
was
not
involved
in
building
the
system
.
Testing
is
usually
relied
upon
to
detect
the
faults
remaining
from
earlier
stages
,
in
addition
to
the
faults
introduced
during
coding
itself
.
Due
to
this
,
different
levels
of
testing
are
used
in
the
testing
process
;
each
level
of
testing
aims
to
test
different
aspects
of
the
system
.
The
basic
levels
are
unit
testing
,
integration
testing
,
system
testing
,
and
acceptance
testing
.
These
different
levels
of
testing
attempt
to
detect
different
types
of
faults
.
The
relation
of
the
faults
introduced
in
different
phases
,
and
the
different
levels
of
testing
are
shown
in
Figure
The
first
level
of
testing
is
called
unit
testing
,
which
we
discussed
in
the
previous
chapter
.
Unit
testing
is
essentially
for
verification
of
the
code
produced
by
individual
programmers
,
and
is
typically
done
by
the
programmer
of
the
module
.
Generally
,
a
module
is
offered
by
a
programmer
for
integration
and
use
by
others
only
after
it
has
been
unit
tested
satisfactorily
.
The
next
level
of
testing
is
often
called
integration
testing
.
In
this
,
many
unit
tested
modules
are
combined
into
subsystems
,
which
are
then
tested
.
The
goal
here
is
to
see
if
the
modules
can
be
integrated
properly
.
Hence
,
the
emphasis
is
on
testing
interfaces
between
modules
.
This
testing
activity
can
be
considered
testing
the
design
.
The
next
levels
are
system
testing
and
acceptance
testing
.
Here
the
entire
software
system
is
tested
.
The
reference
document
for
this
process
is
the
requirements
document
,
and
the
goal
is
to
see
if
the
software
meets
its
require-
ments
.
This
is
often
a
large
exercise
,
which
for
large
projects
may
last
many
weeks
or
months
.
This
is
essentially
a
validation
exercise
,
and
in
many
situa-
tions
it
is
the
only
validation
activity
.
Acceptance
testing
is
often
performed
with
realistic
data
of
the
client
to
demonstrate
that
the
software
is
working
satisfactorily
.
It
may
be
done
in
the
setting
in
which
the
software
is
to
even-
tually
function
.
Acceptance
testing
essentially
tests
if
the
system
satisfactorily
solves
the
problems
for
which
it
was
commissioned
.
These
levels
of
testing
are
performed
when
a
system
is
being
built
from
the
components
that
have
been
coded
.
There
is
another
level
of
testing
,
called
regression
testing
,
that
is
performed
when
some
changes
are
made
to
an
existing
system
.
We
know
that
changes
are
fundamental
to
software
;
any
software
must
undergo
changes
.
However
,
when
modifications
are
made
to
an
existing
system
,
testing
also
has
to
be
done
to
make
sure
that
the
modification
has
not
had
any
undesired
side
effect
of
making
some
of
the
earlier
services
faulty
.
That
is
,
besides
ensuring
the
desired
behavior
of
the
new
services
,
testing
has
to
ensure
that
the
desired
behavior
of
the
old
services
is
maintained
.
This
is
the
task
of
regression
testing
.
For
regression
testing
,
some
test
cases
that
have
been
executed
on
the
old
system
are
maintained
,
along
with
the
output
produced
by
the
old
system
.
These
test
cases
are
executed
again
on
the
modified
system
and
its
output
compared
with
the
earlier
output
to
make
sure
that
the
system
is
working
as
before
on
these
test
cases
.
This
frequently
is
a
major
task
when
modifications
are
to
be
made
to
existing
systems
.
Complete
regression
testing
of
large
systems
can
take
a
considerable
amount
of
time
,
even
if
automation
is
used
.
If
a
small
change
is
made
to
the
system
,
often
practical
considerations
require
that
the
entire
test
suite
not
be
executed
,
but
regression
testing
be
done
with
only
a
subset
of
test
cases
.
This
requires
suitably
selecting
test
cases
from
the
suite
which
can
test
those
parts
of
the
system
that
could
be
affected
by
the
change
.
Test
case
selection
for
regression
testing
is
an
active
research
area
and
many
different
approaches
have
been
proposed
in
the
literature
for
this
.
We
will
not
discuss
it
any
further
.
The
basic
goal
of
the
software
development
process
is
to
produce
software
that
has
no
errors
or
very
few
errors
.
Testing
is
a
quality
control
activity
which
focuses
on
identifying
defects
(
which
are
then
removed
)
.
We
have
seen
that
different
levels
of
testing
are
needed
to
detect
the
defects
injected
during
the
various
tasks
in
the
project
.
And
at
a
level
multiple
SUTs
may
be
tested
.
And
for
testing
each
SUT
,
test
cases
will
have
to
be
designed
and
then
executed
.
Overall
,
testing
in
a
project
is
a
complex
task
which
also
consumes
the
max-
imum
effort
.
Hence
,
testing
has
to
be
done
properly
in
a
project
.
The
testing
process
for
a
project
consists
of
three
high-level
tasks—test
planning
,
test
case
design
,
and
test
execution
.
We
will
discuss
these
in
the
rest
of
this
section
.
In
general
,
in
a
project
,
testing
commences
with
a
test
plan
and
terminates
with
successful
execution
of
acceptance
testing
.
A
test
plan
is
a
general
docu-
ment
for
the
entire
project
that
defines
the
scope
,
approach
to
be
taken
,
and
the
schedule
of
testing
,
as
well
as
identifies
the
test
items
for
testing
and
the
personnel
responsible
for
the
different
activities
of
testing
.
The
test
planning
can
be
done
well
before
the
actual
testing
commences
and
can
be
done
in
par-
allel
with
the
coding
and
design
activities
.
The
inputs
for
forming
the
test
plan
are
:
(
1
)
project
plan
,
(
2
)
requirements
document
,
and
(
3
)
architecture
or
design
document
.
The
project
plan
is
needed
to
make
sure
that
the
test
plan
is
consistent
with
the
overall
quality
plan
for
the
project
and
the
testing
schedule
matches
that
of
the
project
plan
.
The
requirements
document
and
the
design
document
are
the
basic
documents
used
for
selecting
the
test
units
and
decid-
ing
the
approaches
to
be
used
during
testing
.
A
test
plan
should
contain
the
following
:
As
seen
earlier
,
different
levels
of
testing
have
to
be
performed
in
a
project
.
The
levels
are
specified
in
the
test
plan
by
identifying
the
test
units
for
the
project
.
A
test
unit
is
a
set
of
one
or
more
modules
that
form
a
software
under
test
(
SUT
)
.
The
identification
of
test
units
establishes
the
different
levels
of
testing
that
will
be
performed
in
the
project
.
Generally
,
a
number
of
test
units
are
formed
during
the
testing
,
starting
from
the
lower-level
modules
,
which
have
to
be
unit-tested
.
That
is
,
first
the
modules
that
have
to
be
tested
individually
are
specified
as
test
units
.
Then
the
higher-level
units
are
specified
,
which
may
be
a
combination
of
already
tested
units
or
may
combine
some
already
tested
units
with
some
untested
modules
.
The
basic
idea
behind
forming
test
units
is
to
make
sure
that
testing
is
being
performed
incrementally
,
with
each
increment
including
only
a
few
aspects
that
need
to
be
tested
.
An
important
factor
while
forming
a
unit
is
the
“
testability
”
of
a
unit
.
A
unit
should
be
such
that
it
can
be
easily
tested
.
In
other
words
,
it
should
be
possible
to
form
meaningful
test
cases
and
execute
the
unit
without
much
effort
with
these
test
cases
.
For
example
,
a
module
that
manipulates
the
complex
data
structure
formed
from
a
file
input
by
an
input
module
might
not
be
a
suitable
unit
from
the
point
of
view
of
testability
,
as
forming
meaningful
test
cases
for
the
unit
will
be
hard
,
and
driver
routines
will
have
to
be
written
to
convert
inputs
from
files
or
terminals
that
are
given
by
the
tester
into
data
structures
suitable
for
the
module
.
In
this
case
,
it
might
be
better
to
form
the
unit
by
including
the
input
module
as
well
.
Then
the
file
input
expected
by
the
input
module
can
contain
the
test
cases
.
Features
to
be
tested
include
all
software
features
and
combinations
of
fea-
tures
that
should
be
tested
.
A
software
feature
is
a
software
characteristic
spec-
ified
or
implied
by
the
requirements
or
design
documents
.
These
may
include
functionality
,
performance
,
design
constraints
,
and
attributes
.
The
approach
for
testing
specifies
the
overall
approach
to
be
followed
in
the
current
project
.
The
techniques
that
will
be
used
to
judge
the
testing
effort
should
also
be
specified
.
This
is
sometimes
called
the
testing
criterion
or
the
criterion
for
evaluating
the
set
of
test
cases
used
in
testing
.
In
the
previous
sections
we
discussed
many
criteria
for
evaluating
and
selecting
test
cases
.
Testing
deliverables
should
be
specified
in
the
test
plan
before
the
actual
testing
begins
.
Deliverables
could
be
a
list
of
test
cases
that
were
used
,
detailed
results
of
testing
including
the
list
of
defects
found
,
test
summary
report
,
and
data
about
the
code
coverage
.
The
test
plan
typically
also
specifies
the
schedule
and
effort
to
be
spent
on
different
activities
of
testing
,
and
the
tools
to
be
used
.
This
schedule
should
be
consistent
with
the
overall
project
schedule
.
The
detailed
plan
may
list
all
the
testing
tasks
and
allocate
them
to
test
resources
who
are
responsible
for
performing
them
.
Many
large
products
have
separate
testing
teams
and
therefore
a
separate
test
plan
.
A
smaller
project
may
include
the
test
plan
as
part
of
its
quality
plan
in
the
project
management
plan
.
The
test
plan
focuses
on
how
the
testing
for
the
project
will
proceed
,
which
units
will
be
tested
,
and
what
approaches
(
and
tools
)
are
to
be
used
during
the
various
stages
of
testing
.
However
,
it
does
not
deal
with
the
details
of
testing
a
unit
,
nor
does
it
specify
which
test
cases
are
to
be
used
.
Test
case
design
has
to
be
done
separately
for
each
unit
.
Based
on
the
approach
specified
in
the
test
plan
,
and
the
features
to
be
tested
,
the
test
cases
are
designed
and
specified
for
testing
the
unit
.
Test
case
specification
gives
,
for
each
unit
to
be
tested
,
all
test
cases
,
inputs
to
be
used
in
the
test
cases
,
conditions
being
tested
by
the
test
case
,
and
outputs
expected
for
those
test
cases
.
If
test
cases
are
specified
in
a
document
,
the
specifications
look
like
a
table
of
the
form
shown
in
Figure
Sometimes
,
a
few
columns
are
also
provided
for
recording
the
outcome
of
different
rounds
of
testing
.
That
is
,
sometimes
the
test
case
specifications
doc-
ument
is
also
used
to
record
the
result
of
testing
.
In
a
round
of
testing
,
the
outcome
of
all
the
test
cases
is
recorded
(
i.e.
,
pass
or
fail
)
.
Hopefully
,
in
a
few
rounds
all
test
cases
will
pass
.
With
testing
frameworks
and
automated
testing
,
the
testing
scripts
can
be
considered
as
test
case
specifications
,
as
they
clearly
show
what
inputs
are
being
given
and
what
output
to
expect
.
With
suitable
comments
,
the
intent
of
the
test
case
can
also
be
easily
specified
.
Test
case
design
is
a
major
activity
in
the
testing
process
.
Careful
selection
of
test
cases
that
satisfy
the
criterion
and
approach
specified
is
essential
for
proper
testing
.
We
will
later
consider
different
techniques
for
designing
good
test
cases
.
There
are
some
good
reasons
why
test
cases
are
specified
before
they
are
used
for
testing
.
It
is
known
that
testing
has
severe
limitations
and
the
effec-
tiveness
of
testing
depends
very
heavily
on
the
exact
nature
of
the
test
cases
.
It
is
therefore
important
to
ensure
that
the
set
of
test
cases
used
is
of
high
quality
.
Evaluation
of
test
cases
is
often
done
through
test
case
review
.
As
for
any
review
,
a
formal
document
or
work
product
is
needed
,
for
review
of
test
cases
,
the
test
case
specification
document
is
required
.
This
is
the
primary
reason
for
documenting
the
test
cases
.
The
test
case
specification
document
is
reviewed
,
using
a
formal
review
process
,
to
make
sure
that
the
test
cases
are
consistent
with
the
policy
specified
in
the
plan
,
satisfy
the
chosen
criterion
,
and
cover
the
various
aspects
of
the
unit
to
be
tested
.
By
reviewing
the
conditions
being
tested
by
the
test
cases
,
the
reviewers
can
also
check
if
all
the
important
conditions
are
being
tested
.
Another
reason
for
specifying
the
test
cases
in
a
document
or
a
script
is
that
by
doing
this
,
the
tester
can
see
the
testing
of
the
unit
in
totality
and
the
effect
of
the
total
set
of
test
cases
.
This
type
of
evaluation
is
hard
to
do
in
on-the-fly
testing
where
test
cases
are
determined
as
testing
proceeds
.
It
also
allows
optimizing
the
number
of
test
cases
as
evaluation
of
the
test
suite
may
show
that
some
test
cases
are
redundant
.
With
the
specification
of
test
cases
,
the
next
step
in
the
testing
process
is
to
execute
them
.
This
step
is
also
not
straightforward
.
The
test
case
specifications
only
specify
the
set
of
test
cases
for
the
unit
to
be
tested
.
However
,
executing
the
test
cases
may
require
construction
of
driver
modules
or
stubs
.
It
may
also
require
modules
to
set
up
the
environment
as
stated
in
the
test
plan
and
test
case
specifications
.
Only
after
all
these
are
ready
can
the
test
cases
be
executed
.
If
test
frameworks
are
being
used
,
then
the
setting
of
the
environment
as
well
as
inputs
for
a
test
case
is
already
done
in
the
test
scripts
,
and
execution
is
straightforward
.
During
test
case
execution
,
defects
are
found
.
These
defects
are
then
fixed
and
tesing
is
done
again
to
verify
the
fix
.
To
facilitate
reporting
and
tracking
of
defects
found
during
testing
(
and
other
quality
control
activities
)
,
defects
found
are
often
logged
.
Defect
logging
is
particularly
important
in
a
large
software
project
which
may
have
hundreds
or
thousands
of
defects
that
are
found
by
different
people
at
different
stages
of
the
project
.
Often
the
person
who
fixes
a
defect
is
not
the
person
who
finds
or
reports
the
defect
.
For
example
,
a
tester
may
find
the
defect
while
the
developer
of
the
code
may
actually
fix
it
.
In
such
a
scenario
,
defect
reporting
and
closing
can
not
be
done
informally
.
The
use
of
informal
mechanisms
may
easily
lead
to
defects
being
found
but
later
forgotten
,
resulting
in
defects
not
getting
removed
or
in
extra
effort
in
finding
the
defect
again
.
Hence
,
defects
found
must
be
properly
logged
in
a
system
and
their
closure
tracked
.
Defect
logging
and
tracking
is
considered
one
of
the
best
practices
for
managing
a
project
[
17
]
,
and
is
followed
by
most
software
organizations
.
Let
us
understand
the
life
cycle
of
a
defect
.
A
defect
can
be
found
by
anyone
at
anytime
.
When
a
defect
is
found
,
it
is
logged
in
a
defect
control
system
,
along
with
sufficient
information
about
the
defect
.
The
defect
is
then
in
the
state
“
submitted
,
”
essentially
implying
that
it
has
been
logged
along
with
information
about
it
.
The
job
of
fixing
the
defect
is
then
assigned
to
some
person
,
who
is
generally
the
author
of
the
document
or
code
in
which
the
defect
is
found
.
The
assigned
person
does
the
debugging
and
fixes
the
reported
defect
,
and
the
defect
then
enters
the
“
fixed
”
state
.
However
,
a
defect
that
is
fixed
is
still
not
considered
as
fully
done
.
The
successful
fixing
of
the
defect
is
verified
.
This
verification
may
be
done
by
another
person
(
often
the
submitter
)
,
or
by
a
test
team
,
and
typically
involves
running
some
tests
.
Once
the
defect
fixing
is
verified
,
then
the
defect
can
be
marked
as
“
closed.
”
In
other
words
,
the
general
life
cycle
of
a
defect
has
three
states—submitted
,
fixed
,
and
closed
,
as
shown
in
Figure
A
defect
that
is
not
closed
is
also
called
open
.
This
is
a
typical
life
cycle
of
a
defect
which
is
used
in
many
organizations
(
e.g.
,
[
58
]
)
.
Ideally
,
at
the
end
of
the
project
,
no
open
defects
should
remain
.
However
,
this
ideal
situation
is
often
not
practical
for
most
large
systems
.
Besides
using
the
log
for
tracking
defects
,
the
data
in
the
log
can
also
be
used
for
analysis
purposes
.
We
will
discuss
some
possible
analysis
later
in
the
chapter
.
As
we
have
seen
,
good
test
case
design
is
the
key
to
suitable
testing
of
the
SUT
.
The
goal
while
testing
a
SUT
is
to
detect
most
(
hopefully
all
)
of
the
defects
,
through
as
small
a
set
of
test
cases
as
possible
.
Due
to
this
basic
goal
,
it
is
important
to
select
test
cases
carefully—best
are
those
test
cases
that
have
a
high
probability
of
detecting
a
defect
,
if
it
exists
,
and
also
whose
execution
will
give
a
confidence
that
no
failures
during
testing
implies
that
there
are
few
(
hopefully
none
)
defects
in
the
software
.
There
are
two
basic
approaches
to
designing
the
test
cases
to
be
used
in
testing
:
black-box
and
white-box
.
In
black-box
testing
the
structure
of
the
program
is
not
considered
.
Test
cases
are
decided
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
requirements
or
specifications
of
the
program
or
module
,
and
the
internals
of
the
module
or
the
program
are
not
considered
for
selection
of
test
cases
.
In
this
section
,
we
will
present
some
techniques
for
generating
test
cases
for
black-box
testing
.
White-box
testing
is
discussed
in
the
next
section
.
In
black-box
testing
,
the
tester
only
knows
the
inputs
that
can
be
given
to
the
system
and
what
output
the
system
should
give
.
In
other
words
,
the
basis
for
deciding
test
cases
is
the
requirements
or
specifications
of
the
system
or
module
.
This
form
of
testing
is
also
called
functional
or
behavioral
testing
.
The
most
obvious
functional
testing
procedure
is
exhaustive
testing
,
which
is
impractical
.
One
criterion
for
generating
test
cases
is
to
generate
them
ran-
domly
.
This
strategy
has
little
chance
of
resulting
in
a
set
of
test
cases
that
is
close
to
optimal
(
i.e.
,
that
detects
the
maximum
errors
with
minimum
test
cases
)
.
Hence
,
we
need
some
other
criterion
or
rule
for
selecting
test
cases
.
There
are
no
formal
rules
for
designing
test
cases
for
functional
testing
.
How-
ever
,
there
are
a
number
of
techniques
or
heuristics
that
can
be
used
to
select
test
cases
that
have
been
found
to
be
very
successful
in
detecting
errors
.
Here
we
mention
some
of
these
techniques
.
Because
we
can
not
do
exhaustive
testing
,
the
next
natural
approach
is
to
divide
the
input
domain
into
a
set
of
equivalence
classes
,
so
that
if
the
program
works
correctly
for
a
value
,
then
it
will
work
correctly
for
all
the
other
values
in
that
class
.
If
we
can
indeed
identify
such
classes
,
then
testing
the
program
with
one
value
from
each
equivalence
class
is
equivalent
to
doing
an
exhaustive
test
of
the
program
.
However
,
without
looking
at
the
internal
structure
of
the
program
,
it
is
impossible
to
determine
such
ideal
equivalence
classes
(
even
with
the
internal
structure
,
it
usually
can
not
be
done
)
.
The
equivalence
class
partitioning
method
[
68
]
tries
to
approximate
this
ideal
.
An
equivalence
class
is
formed
of
the
inputs
for
which
the
behavior
of
the
system
is
specified
or
expected
to
be
similar
.
Each
group
of
inputs
for
which
the
behavior
is
expected
to
be
different
from
others
is
considered
a
separate
equivalence
class
.
The
rationale
of
forming
equivalence
classes
like
this
is
the
assumption
that
if
the
specifications
require
the
same
behavior
for
each
element
in
a
class
of
values
,
then
the
program
is
likely
to
be
constructed
so
that
it
either
succeeds
or
fails
for
each
of
the
values
in
that
class
.
For
example
,
the
specifications
of
a
module
that
determines
the
absolute
value
for
integers
specify
one
behavior
for
positive
integers
and
another
for
negative
integers
.
In
this
case
,
we
will
form
two
equivalence
classes—one
consisting
of
positive
integers
and
the
other
consisting
of
negative
integers
.
For
robust
software
,
we
must
also
consider
invalid
inputs
.
That
is
,
we
should
define
equivalence
classes
for
invalid
inputs
also
.
Equivalence
classes
are
usually
formed
by
considering
each
condition
speci-
fied
on
an
input
as
specifying
a
valid
equivalence
class
and
one
or
more
invalid
equivalence
classes
.
For
example
,
if
an
input
condition
specifies
a
range
of
val-
ues
(
say
,
0
<
count
<
Max
)
,
then
form
a
valid
equivalence
class
with
that
range
and
two
invalid
equivalence
classes
,
one
with
values
less
than
the
lower
bound
of
the
range
(
i.e.
,
count
<
0
)
and
the
other
with
values
higher
than
the
higher
bound
(
count
>
Max
)
.
If
the
input
specifies
a
set
of
values
and
the
require-
ments
specify
different
behavior
for
different
elements
in
the
set
,
then
a
valid
equivalence
class
is
formed
for
each
of
the
elements
in
the
set
and
an
invalid
class
for
an
entity
not
belonging
to
the
set
.
One
common
approach
for
determining
equivalence
classes
is
as
follows
.
If
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
entire
range
of
an
input
will
not
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
,
then
the
range
should
be
split
into
two
or
more
equivalence
classes
,
each
consisting
of
values
for
which
the
behavior
is
expected
to
be
sim-
ilar
.
For
example
,
for
a
character
input
,
if
we
have
reasons
to
believe
that
the
program
will
perform
different
actions
if
the
character
is
a
letter
,
a
number
,
or
a
special
character
,
then
we
should
split
the
input
into
three
valid
equivalence
Another
approach
for
forming
equivalence
classes
is
to
consider
any
special
value
for
which
the
behavior
could
be
different
as
an
equivalence
class
.
For
example
,
the
value
0
could
be
a
special
value
for
an
integer
input
.
Also
,
for
each
valid
equivalence
class
,
one
or
more
invalid
equivalence
classes
should
be
identified
.
It
is
often
useful
to
consider
equivalence
classes
in
the
output
.
For
an
output
equivalence
class
,
the
goal
is
to
have
inputs
such
that
the
output
for
that
test
case
lies
in
the
output
equivalence
class
.
As
an
example
,
consider
a
program
for
determining
rate
of
return
for
some
investment
.
There
are
three
clear
output
equivalence
classes—positive
rate
of
return
,
negative
rate
of
return
,
and
zero
rate
of
return
.
During
testing
,
it
is
important
to
test
for
each
of
these
,
that
is
,
give
inputs
such
that
each
of
these
three
outputs
is
generated
.
Determining
test
cases
for
output
classes
may
be
more
difficult
,
but
output
classes
have
been
found
to
reveal
errors
that
are
not
revealed
by
just
considering
the
input
classes
.
Once
equivalence
classes
are
selected
for
each
of
the
inputs
,
then
the
issue
is
to
select
test
cases
suitably
.
There
are
different
ways
to
select
the
test
cases
.
One
strategy
is
to
select
each
test
case
covering
as
many
valid
equivalence
classes
as
it
can
,
and
one
separate
test
case
for
each
invalid
equivalence
class
.
A
somewhat
better
strategy
which
requires
more
test
cases
is
to
have
a
test
case
cover
at
most
one
valid
equivalence
class
for
each
input
,
and
have
one
separate
test
case
for
each
invalid
equivalence
class
.
In
the
latter
case
,
the
number
of
test
cases
for
valid
equivalence
classes
is
equal
to
the
largest
number
of
equivalence
classes
for
any
input
,
plus
the
total
number
of
invalid
equivalence
classes
.
As
an
example
,
consider
a
program
that
takes
two
inputs—a
string
s
of
length
up
to
N
and
an
integer
n.
The
program
is
to
determine
the
top
n
highest
occurring
characters
in
s.
The
tester
believes
that
the
programmer
may
deal
with
different
types
of
characters
separately
.
One
set
of
valid
and
invalid
equivalence
classes
for
this
is
shown
in
Table
With
these
as
the
equivalence
classes
,
we
have
to
select
the
test
cases
.
A
test
case
for
this
is
a
pair
of
values
for
s
and
n.
With
the
first
strategy
for
deciding
test
cases
,
one
test
case
could
be
:
s
as
a
string
of
length
less
than
N
containing
lowercase
,
uppercase
,
numbers
,
and
special
characters
;
and
n
as
the
number
5
.
This
one
test
case
covers
all
the
valid
equivalence
classes
(
EQ6
)
.
Then
we
will
have
one
test
case
each
for
covering
IEQ1
,
IEQ2
,
and
IEQ3
.
That
is
,
a
total
of
four
test
cases
is
needed
.
With
the
second
approach
,
in
one
test
case
we
can
cover
one
equivalence
class
for
one
input
only
.
So
,
one
test
case
could
be
:
a
string
of
numbers
,
and
the
number
5
.
This
covers
EQ6
.
Then
we
will
need
test
cases
for
EQ5
,
and
separate
test
cases
for
IEQ3
.
It
has
been
observed
that
programs
that
work
correctly
for
a
set
of
values
in
an
equivalence
class
fail
on
some
special
values
.
These
values
often
lie
on
the
boundary
of
the
equivalence
class
.
Test
cases
that
have
values
on
the
boundaries
of
equivalence
classes
are
therefore
likely
to
be
“
high-yield
”
test
cases
,
and
selecting
such
test
cases
is
the
aim
of
boundary
value
analysis
.
In
boundary
value
analysis
[
68
]
,
we
choose
an
input
for
a
test
case
from
an
equivalence
class
,
such
that
the
input
lies
at
the
edge
of
the
equivalence
classes
.
Boundary
values
for
each
equivalence
class
,
including
the
equivalence
classes
of
the
output
,
should
be
covered
.
Boundary
value
test
cases
are
also
called
“
extreme
cases.
”
Hence
,
we
can
say
that
a
boundary
value
test
case
is
a
set
of
input
data
that
lies
on
the
edge
or
boundary
of
a
class
of
input
data
or
that
generates
output
that
lies
at
the
boundary
of
a
class
of
output
data
.
In
case
of
ranges
,
for
boundary
value
analysis
it
is
useful
to
select
the
boundary
elements
of
the
range
and
an
invalid
value
just
beyond
the
two
ends
(
for
the
two
invalid
equivalence
classes
)
.
So
,
if
the
range
is
0.0
x
1.0
,
then
the
test
cases
are
0.0
,
1.0
(
valid
inputs
)
,
and
0.1
,
and
1.1
(
for
invalid
inputs
)
.
Similarly
,
if
the
input
is
a
list
,
attention
should
be
focused
on
the
first
and
last
elements
of
the
list
.
We
should
also
consider
the
outputs
for
boundary
value
analysis
.
If
an
equivalence
class
can
be
identified
in
the
output
,
we
should
try
to
generate
test
cases
that
will
produce
the
output
that
lies
at
the
boundaries
of
the
equivalence
classes
.
Furthermore
,
we
should
try
to
form
test
cases
that
will
produce
an
output
that
does
not
lie
in
the
equivalence
class
.
(
If
we
can
produce
an
input
case
that
produces
the
output
outside
the
equivalence
class
,
we
have
detected
an
error
.
)
Like
in
equivalence
class
partitioning
,
in
boundary
value
analysis
we
first
determine
values
for
each
of
the
variables
that
should
be
exercised
during
test-
ing
.
If
there
are
multiple
inputs
,
then
how
should
the
set
of
test
cases
be
formed
covering
the
boundary
values
?
Suppose
each
input
variable
has
a
defined
range
.
Then
there
are
six
boundary
values—the
extreme
ends
of
the
range
,
just
be-
yond
the
ends
,
and
just
before
the
ends
.
If
an
integer
range
is
min
to
max
,
then
the
six
values
are
min
1
,
min
,
min
+
1
,
max
1
,
max
,
max
+
1
.
Suppose
there
are
n
such
input
variables
.
There
are
two
strategies
for
combining
the
boundary
values
for
the
different
variables
in
test
cases
.
In
the
first
strategy
,
we
select
the
different
boundary
values
for
one
variable
,
and
keep
the
other
variables
at
some
nominal
value
.
And
we
select
one
test
case
consisting
of
nominal
values
of
all
the
variables
.
In
this
case
,
we
will
have
6n+
.
For
two
variables
X
and
Y
,
the
1
Another
strategy
would
be
to
try
all
possible
combinations
for
the
values
for
the
different
variables
.
As
there
are
seven
values
for
each
variable
(
six
boundary
values
and
one
nominal
value
)
,
if
there
are
n
variables
,
there
will
be
a
total
of
7n
test
cases—too
large
for
practical
testing
.
There
are
generally
many
parameters
that
determine
the
behavior
of
a
software
system
.
These
parameters
could
be
direct
input
to
the
software
or
implicit
settings
like
those
for
devices
.
These
parameters
can
take
different
values
,
and
for
some
of
them
the
software
may
not
work
correctly
.
Many
of
the
defects
in
software
generally
involve
one
condition
,
that
is
,
some
special
value
of
one
of
the
parameters
.
Such
a
defect
is
called
a
single-mode
fault
[
70
]
.
Simple
examples
of
single-mode
faults
are
a
software
not
able
to
print
for
a
particular
type
of
printer
,
a
software
that
can
not
compute
fare
properly
when
the
traveler
is
a
minor
,
and
a
telephone
billing
software
that
does
not
compute
the
bill
properly
for
a
particular
country
.
Single-mode
faults
can
be
detected
by
testing
for
different
values
of
dif-
ferent
parameters
.
So
,
if
there
are
n
parameters
for
a
system
,
and
each
one
of
them
can
take
m
different
values
(
or
m
different
classes
of
values
,
each
class
being
considered
as
the
same
for
purposes
of
testing
as
in
equivalence
class
partitioning
)
,
then
with
each
test
case
we
can
test
one
different
value
of
each
parameter
.
In
other
words
,
we
can
test
for
all
the
different
values
in
m
test
cases
.
However
,
all
faults
are
not
single-mode
and
there
are
combinations
of
inputs
that
reveal
the
presence
of
faults
:
for
example
,
a
telephone
billing
software
that
does
not
compute
correctly
for
nighttime
calling
(
one
parameter
)
to
a
particular
country
(
another
parameter
)
,
or
an
airline
ticketing
system
that
has
incorrect
behavior
when
a
minor
(
one
parameter
)
is
traveling
business
class
(
another
parameter
)
and
not
staying
over
the
weekend
(
third
parameter
)
.
These
multi-
mode
faults
can
be
revealed
during
testing
by
trying
different
combinations
of
the
parameter
values—an
approach
called
combinatorial
testing
.
Unfortunately
,
full
combinatorial
testing
is
often
not
feasible
.
For
a
system
with
n
parameters
,
each
having
m
values
,
the
number
of
different
combinations
is
nm
.
For
a
simple
system
with
,
each
having
,
the
total
number
of
combinations
is
3,125
.
And
if
testing
each
combination
takes
,
it
will
take
over
.
Clearly
,
for
complex
systems
that
have
many
parameters
and
each
parameter
may
have
many
values
,
a
full
combinatorial
testing
is
not
feasible
and
practical
techniques
are
needed
to
reduce
the
number
of
tests
.
Some
research
has
suggested
that
most
software
faults
are
revealed
on
some
special
single
values
or
by
interaction
of
a
pair
of
values
[
25
]
.
That
it
,
most
faults
tend
to
be
either
single-mode
or
double-mode
.
For
testing
for
double-
mode
faults
,
we
need
not
test
the
system
with
all
the
combinations
of
parameter
values
,
but
need
to
test
such
that
all
combinations
of
values
for
each
pair
of
parameters
are
exercised
.
This
is
called
pairwise
testing
.
In
pairwise
testing
,
all
pairs
of
values
have
to
be
exercised
during
testing
.
If
there
are
n
parameters
,
each
with
m
values
,
then
between
each
two
parameter
we
have
m
∗
m
pairs
.
The
first
parameter
will
have
these
many
pairs
with
each
of
the
remaining
n
−
,
the
second
one
will
have
new
pairs
with
n
−
(
as
its
pairs
with
the
first
are
already
included
in
the
first
parameter
pairs
)
,
the
third
will
have
pairs
with
n
−
,
and
so
on
.
That
is
,
the
total
number
of
pairs
is
m
∗
m
∗
n
∗
(
n
−
1
)
/2
.
The
objective
of
pairwise
testing
is
to
have
a
set
of
test
cases
that
cover
all
the
pairs
.
As
there
are
n
parameters
,
a
test
case
is
a
combination
of
values
of
these
parameters
and
will
cover
(
n
1
)
+
(
n
2
)
+
...
=
n
(
n
1
)
/
.
In
the
best
case
when
each
pair
is
covered
exactly
once
by
one
test
case
,
m
.
As
an
example
,
consider
a
software
product
being
developed
for
multiple
platforms
that
uses
the
browser
as
its
interface
.
Suppose
the
software
is
be-
ing
designed
to
work
for
three
different
operating
systems
and
three
different
browsers
.
In
addition
,
as
the
product
is
memory
intensive
there
is
a
desire
to
test
its
performance
under
different
levels
of
memory
.
So
,
we
have
the
following
three
parameters
with
their
different
values
:
Operating
System
:
Windows
,
Solaris
,
Linux
Memory
Size
:
128M
,
256M
,
512M
For
discussion
,
we
can
say
that
the
system
has
three
parameters
:
A
(
op-
erating
system
)
,
B
(
memory
size
)
,
and
C
(
browser
)
.
Each
of
them
can
have
three
values
which
we
will
refer
to
as
a1
,
a2
,
a3
,
b1
,
b2
,
b3
,
and
c1
,
c2
,
c3
.
The
total
number
of
pairwise
combinations
is
9
*
3
=
27
.
The
number
of
test
cases
,
however
,
to
cover
all
the
pairs
is
much
less
.
A
test
case
consisting
of
values
of
the
three
parameters
covers
three
combinations
(
of
A-B
,
B-C
,
and
A-C
)
.
Hence
,
in
the
best
case
,
we
can
cover
all
227/3=
.
These
test
cases
are
shown
in
Table
along
with
the
pairs
they
cover
.
As
should
be
clear
,
generating
test
cases
to
cover
all
the
pairs
is
not
a
simple
task
.
The
minimum
set
of
test
cases
is
that
in
which
each
pair
is
covered
by
exactly
one
test
case
.
Often
,
it
will
not
be
possible
to
generate
the
minimum
set
of
test
cases
,
particularly
when
the
number
of
values
for
different
parameters
is
different
.
Various
algorithms
have
been
proposed
,
and
some
programs
are
available
online
to
generate
the
test
cases
to
cover
all
the
pairs
.
For
situations
where
manual
generation
is
feasible
,
the
following
approach
can
be
followed
.
Start
with
initial
test
cases
formed
by
all
combinations
of
values
for
the
two
parameters
which
have
the
largest
number
of
values
(
as
we
must
have
at
least
this
many
test
cases
to
test
all
the
pairs
for
these
two
parameters
)
.
Then
complete
each
of
these
test
cases
by
adding
value
for
other
parameters
such
that
they
add
pairs
that
have
not
yet
been
covered
by
any
test
case
.
When
all
are
completed
,
form
additional
test
cases
by
combining
as
many
uncovered
pairs
as
possible
.
Essentially
we
are
generating
test
cases
such
that
a
test
case
covers
as
many
new
pairs
as
possible
.
By
avoiding
covering
pairs
multiple
times
,
we
can
produce
a
small
set
of
test
cases
that
cover
all
pairs
.
Efficient
algorithms
of
generating
the
smallest
number
of
test
cases
for
pairwise
testing
exist
.
In
[
25
]
an
example
is
given
in
which
for
1
,
each
having
three
distinct
values
,
all
pairs
are
covered
in
merely
1
,
while
the
total
number
of
combinations
is
over
!
Pairwise
testing
is
a
practical
way
of
testing
large
software
systems
that
have
many
different
parameters
with
distinct
functioning
expected
for
different
values
.
An
example
would
be
a
billing
system
(
for
telephone
,
hotel
,
airline
,
etc
.
)
which
has
different
rates
for
different
parameter
values
.
It
is
also
a
practical
approach
for
testing
general-purpose
software
products
that
are
expected
to
run
on
different
platforms
and
configurations
,
or
a
system
that
is
expected
to
work
with
different
types
of
systems
.
It
has
been
seen
that
programs
often
produce
incorrect
behavior
when
inputs
form
some
special
cases
.
The
reason
is
that
in
programs
,
some
combinations
of
inputs
need
special
treatment
,
and
providing
proper
handling
for
these
special
cases
is
easily
overlooked
.
For
example
,
in
an
arithmetic
routine
,
if
there
is
a
division
and
the
divisor
is
zero
,
some
special
action
has
to
be
taken
,
which
could
easily
be
forgotten
by
the
programmer
.
These
special
cases
form
particularly
good
test
cases
,
which
can
reveal
errors
that
will
usually
not
be
detected
by
other
test
cases
.
Special
cases
will
often
depend
on
the
data
structures
and
the
function
of
the
module
.
There
are
no
rules
to
determine
special
cases
,
and
the
tester
has
to
use
his
intuition
and
experience
to
identify
such
test
cases
.
Consequently
,
determining
special
cases
is
also
called
error
guessing
.
Psychology
is
particularly
important
for
error
guessing
.
The
tester
should
play
the
“
devil
’
s
advocate
”
and
try
to
guess
the
incorrect
assumptions
the
programmer
could
have
made
and
the
situations
the
programmer
could
have
overlooked
or
handled
incorrectly
.
Essentially
,
the
tester
is
trying
to
identify
error-prone
situations
.
Then
test
cases
are
written
for
these
situations
.
For
example
,
in
the
problem
of
finding
the
number
of
different
words
in
a
file
(
discussed
in
earlier
chapters
)
some
of
the
special
cases
can
be
:
file
is
empty
,
only
one
word
in
the
file
,
only
one
word
in
a
line
,
some
empty
lines
in
the
input
file
,
presence
of
more
than
one
blank
between
words
,
all
words
are
the
same
,
the
words
are
already
sorted
,
and
blanks
at
the
start
and
end
of
the
file
.
Incorrect
assumptions
are
usually
made
because
the
specifications
are
not
complete
or
the
writer
of
specifications
may
not
have
stated
some
properties
,
assuming
them
to
be
obvious
.
Whenever
there
is
reliance
on
tacit
understanding
rather
than
explicit
statement
of
specifications
,
there
is
scope
for
making
wrong
assumptions
.
Frequently
,
wrong
assumptions
are
made
about
the
environments
.
However
,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
special
cases
depend
heavily
on
the
problem
,
and
the
tester
should
really
try
to
“
get
into
the
shoes
”
of
the
designer
and
coder
to
determine
these
cases
.
There
are
some
systems
that
are
essentially
stateless
in
that
for
the
same
inputs
they
always
give
the
same
outputs
or
exhibit
the
same
behavior
.
Many
batch
processing
systems
,
computational
systems
,
and
servers
fall
in
this
category
.
In
hardware
,
combinatorial
circuits
fall
in
this
category
.
At
a
smaller
level
,
most
functions
are
supposed
to
behave
in
this
manner
.
There
are
,
however
,
many
systems
whose
behavior
is
state-based
in
that
for
identical
inputs
they
behave
differently
at
different
times
and
may
produce
different
outputs
.
The
reason
for
different
behavior
is
that
the
state
of
the
system
may
be
different
.
In
other
words
,
the
behavior
and
outputs
of
the
system
depend
not
only
on
the
inputs
provided
,
but
also
on
the
state
of
the
system
.
The
state
of
the
system
depends
on
the
past
inputs
the
system
has
received
.
In
other
words
,
the
state
represents
the
cumulative
impact
of
all
the
past
inputs
on
the
system
.
In
hardware
,
the
sequential
systems
fall
in
this
category
.
In
software
,
many
large
systems
fall
in
this
category
as
past
state
is
captured
in
databases
or
files
and
used
to
control
the
behavior
of
the
system
.
For
such
systems
,
another
approach
for
selecting
test
cases
is
the
state-based
testing
approach
[
22
]
.
Theoretically
,
any
software
that
saves
state
can
be
modeled
as
a
state
ma-
chine
.
However
,
the
state
space
of
any
reasonable
program
is
almost
infinite
,
as
it
is
a
cross
product
of
the
domains
of
all
the
variables
that
form
the
state
.
For
many
systems
the
state
space
can
be
partitioned
into
a
few
states
,
each
representing
a
logical
combination
of
values
of
different
state
variables
which
share
some
property
of
interest
[
9
]
.
If
the
set
of
states
of
a
system
is
manage-
able
,
a
state
model
of
the
system
can
be
built
.
A
state
model
for
a
system
has
four
components
:
States
.
Represent
the
impact
of
the
past
inputs
to
the
system
.
Transitions
.
Represent
how
the
state
of
the
system
changes
from
one
state
to
another
in
response
to
some
events
.
The
state
model
shows
what
state
transitions
occur
and
what
actions
are
performed
in
a
system
in
response
to
events
.
When
a
state
model
is
built
from
the
requirements
of
a
system
,
we
can
only
include
the
states
,
transitions
,
and
actions
that
are
stated
in
the
requirements
or
can
be
inferred
from
them
.
If
more
information
is
available
from
the
design
specifications
,
then
a
richer
state
model
can
be
built
.
For
example
,
consider
the
student
survey
example
discussed
in
Chapter
5
.
According
to
the
requirements
,
a
system
is
to
be
created
for
taking
a
student
survey
.
The
student
takes
a
survey
and
is
returned
the
current
result
of
the
survey
.
The
survey
result
can
be
up
to
five
surveys
old
.
We
consider
the
archi-
tecture
which
had
a
cache
between
the
server
and
the
database
,
and
in
which
the
survey
and
results
are
cached
and
updated
only
after
five
surveys
,
on
arrival
of
a
request
.
The
proposed
architecture
has
a
database
at
the
back
,
which
may
go
down
.
To
create
a
state
machine
model
of
this
system
,
we
notice
that
of
a
series
of
,
the
first
.
Hence
,
we
divide
into
two
states
:
one
representing
the
the
receiving
of
1
(
state
1
)
,
and
the
other
representing
the
receiving
of
request
5
(
state
2
)
.
Next
we
see
that
the
database
can
be
up
or
down
,
and
it
can
go
down
in
any
of
these
two
states
.
However
,
the
behavior
of
requests
,
if
the
database
is
down
,
may
be
different
.
Hence
,
we
create
another
pair
of
states
(
states
4
)
.
Once
the
database
has
failed
,
then
the
first
.
When
a
request
is
received
after
receiving
,
the
system
enters
a
failed
state
(
state
5
)
,
in
which
it
does
not
give
any
response
.
When
the
system
recovers
from
the
failed
state
,
it
must
update
its
cache
immediately
,
hence
goes
to
state
2
.
The
state
model
for
this
system
is
shown
in
Figure
(
i
represents
an
input
from
the
user
for
taking
the
survey
)
.
Note
that
we
are
assuming
that
the
state
model
of
the
system
can
be
created
from
its
specifications
or
design
.
This
is
how
most
state
modeling
is
done
,
and
that
is
how
the
model
was
built
in
the
example
.
Once
the
state
model
is
built
,
we
can
use
it
to
select
test
cases
.
When
the
design
is
implemented
,
these
test
cases
can
be
used
for
testing
the
code
.
It
is
because
of
this
we
treat
state-based
testing
as
a
black
box
testing
strategy
.
However
,
the
state
model
often
requires
information
about
the
design
of
the
system
.
In
the
example
above
,
some
knowledge
of
the
architecture
is
utilized
.
Sometimes
making
the
state
model
may
require
detailed
information
about
the
design
of
the
system
.
For
example
,
for
a
class
,
we
have
seen
that
the
state
modeling
is
done
during
design
,
and
when
a
lot
is
already
known
about
the
class
,
its
attributes
,
and
its
methods
.
Due
to
this
,
the
state-based
testing
may
be
considered
as
somewhat
between
black-box
and
white-box
testing
.
Such
strategies
are
sometimes
called
gray-box
testing
.
Given
a
state
model
of
a
system
,
how
should
test
cases
be
generated
?
Many
coverage
criteria
have
been
proposed
[
69
]
.
We
discuss
only
a
few
here
.
Suppose
the
set
of
test
cases
is
T.
Some
of
the
criteria
are
:
All
transition
coverage
(
AT
)
.
T
must
ensure
that
every
transition
in
the
state
graph
is
exercised
.
All
transitions
pair
coverage
(
ATP
)
.
T
must
execute
all
pairs
of
adja-
cent
transitions
.
(
An
adjacent
transition
pair
comprises
two
transitions
:
an
incoming
transition
to
a
state
and
an
outgoing
transition
from
that
state
.
)
Transition
tree
coverage
(
TT
)
.
T
must
execute
all
simple
paths
,
where
a
simple
path
is
one
which
starts
from
the
start
state
and
reaches
a
state
that
it
has
already
visited
in
this
path
or
a
final
state
.
The
first
criterion
states
that
during
testing
all
transitions
get
fired
.
This
will
also
ensure
that
all
states
are
visited
.
The
transition
pair
coverage
is
a
stronger
criterion
requiring
that
all
combinations
of
incoming
and
outgoing
transitions
for
each
state
must
be
exercised
by
T.
If
a
state
has
two
incoming
transitions
t2
,
and
two
outgoing
transitions
t4
,
then
a
set
of
test
cases
T
that
executes
t1
;
t2
;
t.
However
,
to
satisfy
ATP
,
T
must
also
ensure
execution
of
t1
;
t2
;
t3
.
The
transition
tree
coverage
is
named
in
this
manner
as
a
transition
tree
can
be
constructed
from
the
graph
and
then
used
to
identify
the
paths
.
In
ATP
,
we
are
going
beyond
transitions
,
and
stating
that
different
paths
in
the
state
diagram
should
be
exercised
during
testing
.
ATP
will
generally
include
AT
.
For
the
example
above
,
the
set
of
test
cases
for
AT
are
given
below
in
Table
Here
req
(
)
means
that
a
request
for
taking
the
survey
should
be
given
,
fail
(
)
means
that
the
database
should
be
failed
,
and
recover
(
)
means
that
the
failed
database
should
be
recovered
.
As
we
can
see
,
state-based
testing
draws
attention
to
the
states
and
transi-
tions
.
Even
in
the
above
simple
case
,
we
can
see
different
scenarios
get
tested
(
e.g.
,
system
behavior
when
the
database
fails
,
and
system
behavior
when
it
fails
and
recovers
thereafter
)
.
Many
of
these
scenarios
are
easy
to
overlook
if
test
cases
are
designed
only
by
looking
at
the
input
domains
.
The
set
of
test
cases
is
richer
if
the
other
criteria
are
used
.
For
this
example
,
we
leave
it
as
an
exercise
to
determine
the
test
cases
for
other
criteria
.
In
the
previous
section
we
discussed
black-box
testing
,
which
is
concerned
with
the
function
that
the
tested
program
is
supposed
to
perform
and
does
not
deal
with
the
internal
structure
of
the
program
responsible
for
actually
imple-
menting
that
function
.
Thus
,
black-box
testing
is
concerned
with
functionality
rather
than
implementation
of
the
program
.
White-box
testing
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
concerned
with
testing
the
implementation
of
the
program
.
The
intent
of
this
testing
is
not
to
exercise
all
the
different
input
or
output
conditions
(
al-
though
that
may
be
a
by-product
)
but
to
exercise
the
different
programming
structures
and
data
structures
used
in
the
program
.
White-box
testing
is
also
called
structural
testing
,
and
we
will
use
the
two
terms
interchangeably
.
To
test
the
structure
of
a
program
,
structural
testing
aims
to
achieve
test
cases
that
will
force
the
desired
coverage
of
different
structures
.
Various
criteria
have
been
proposed
for
this
.
Unlike
the
criteria
for
functional
testing
,
which
are
frequently
imprecise
,
the
criteria
for
structural
testing
are
generally
quite
precise
as
they
are
based
on
program
structures
,
which
are
formal
and
precise
.
Here
we
will
discuss
one
approach
to
structural
testing
:
control
flow-based
testing
,
which
is
most
commonly
used
in
practice
.
Most
common
structure-based
criteria
are
based
on
the
control
flow
of
the
program
.
In
these
criteria
,
the
control
flow
graph
of
a
program
is
considered
and
coverage
of
various
aspects
of
the
graph
are
specified
as
criteria
.
Hence
,
before
we
consider
the
criteria
,
let
us
precisely
define
a
control
flow
graph
for
a
program
.
Let
the
control
flow
graph
(
or
simply
flow
graph
)
of
a
program
P
be
G.
A
node
in
this
graph
represents
a
block
of
statements
that
is
always
executed
together
,
i.e.
,
whenever
the
first
statement
is
executed
,
all
other
statements
are
also
executed
.
An
edge
(
i
,
j
)
(
from
node
i
to
node
j
)
represents
a
possible
transfer
of
control
after
executing
the
last
statement
of
the
block
represented
by
node
i
to
the
first
statement
of
the
block
represented
by
node
j
.
A
node
corresponding
to
a
block
whose
first
statement
is
the
start
statement
of
P
is
called
the
start
node
of
G
,
and
a
node
corresponding
to
a
block
whose
last
statement
is
an
exit
statement
is
called
an
exit
node
[
73
]
.
A
path
is
a
finite
sequence
of
nodes
(
n1
,
n2
,
...
,
nk
)
,
k
>
1
,
such
that
there
is
an
edge
(
ni
,
ni+1
)
for
all
nodes
ni
in
the
sequence
(
except
the
last
node
nk
)
.
A
complete
path
is
a
path
whose
first
node
is
the
start
node
and
the
last
node
is
an
exit
node
.
Now
let
us
consider
control
flow-based
criteria
.
Perhaps
the
simplest
cover-
age
criterion
is
statement
coverage
,
which
requires
that
each
statement
of
the
program
be
executed
at
least
once
during
testing
.
In
other
words
,
it
requires
that
the
paths
executed
during
testing
include
all
the
nodes
in
the
graph
.
This
is
also
called
the
all-nodes
criterion
[
73
]
.
This
coverage
criterion
is
not
very
strong
,
and
can
leave
errors
undetected
.
For
example
,
if
there
is
an
if
statement
in
the
program
without
having
an
else
clause
,
the
statement
coverage
criterion
for
this
statement
will
be
satisfied
by
a
test
case
that
evaluates
the
condition
to
true
.
No
test
case
is
needed
that
ensures
that
the
condition
in
the
if
statement
evaluates
to
false
.
This
is
a
serious
shortcoming
because
decisions
in
programs
are
potential
sources
of
errors
.
As
an
example
,
consider
the
following
function
to
compute
the
absolute
value
of
a
number
:
This
program
is
clearly
wrong
.
Suppose
we
execute
the
function
with
the
set
of
test
cases
x=0
(
i.e.
,
the
set
has
only
one
test
case
)
.
The
statement
coverage
criterion
will
be
satisfied
by
testing
with
this
set
,
but
the
error
will
not
be
revealed
.
A
more
general
coverage
criterion
is
branch
coverage
,
which
requires
that
each
edge
in
the
control
flow
graph
be
traversed
at
least
once
during
testing
.
In
other
words
,
branch
coverage
requires
that
each
decision
in
the
program
be
evaluated
to
true
and
false
values
at
least
once
during
testing
.
Testing
based
on
branch
coverage
is
often
called
branch
testing
.
The
100
%
branch
coverage
criterion
is
also
called
the
all-edges
criterion
[
73
]
.
Branch
coverage
implies
state-
ment
coverage
,
as
each
statement
is
a
part
of
some
branch
.
In
the
preceding
example
,
a
set
of
test
cases
satisfying
this
criterion
will
detect
the
error
.
The
trouble
with
branch
coverage
comes
if
a
decision
has
many
conditions
in
it
(
consisting
of
a
Boolean
expression
with
Boolean
operators
and
and
or
)
.
In
such
situations
,
a
decision
can
evaluate
to
true
and
false
without
actually
exercising
all
the
conditions
.
For
example
,
consider
the
following
function
that
checks
the
validity
of
a
data
item
.
The
data
item
is
valid
if
it
lies
between
0
and
100
.
The
module
is
incorrect
,
as
it
is
checking
for
x
200
instead
of
100
(
perhaps
a
typing
error
made
by
the
programmer
)
.
Suppose
the
module
is
tested
with
the
following
set
of
test
cases
:
x
=
5
,
x
=
-
.
The
branch
coverage
criterion
will
be
satisfied
for
this
module
by
this
set
.
However
,
the
error
will
not
be
revealed
,
and
the
behavior
of
the
module
is
consistent
with
its
specifications
for
all
test
cases
in
this
set
.
Thus
,
the
coverage
criterion
is
satisfied
,
but
the
error
is
not
detected
.
This
occurs
because
the
decision
is
evaluating
to
true
and
false
because
of
the
condition
(
x
0
)
.
The
condition
(
x
200
)
never
evaluates
to
false
during
this
test
,
hence
the
error
in
this
condition
is
not
revealed
.
This
problem
can
be
resolved
by
requiring
that
all
conditions
evaluate
to
true
and
false
.
However
,
situations
can
occur
where
a
decision
may
not
get
both
true
and
false
values
even
if
each
individual
condition
evaluates
to
true
and
false
.
An
obvious
solution
to
this
problem
is
to
require
decision/condition
coverage
,
where
all
the
decisions
and
all
the
conditions
in
the
decisions
take
both
true
and
false
values
during
the
course
of
testing
.
Studies
have
indicated
that
there
are
many
errors
whose
presence
is
not
de-
tected
by
branch
testing
because
some
errors
are
related
to
some
combinations
of
branches
and
their
presence
is
revealed
by
an
execution
that
follows
the
path
that
includes
those
branches
.
Hence
,
a
more
general
coverage
criterion
is
one
that
requires
all
possible
paths
in
the
control
flow
graph
be
executed
during
testing
.
This
is
called
the
path
coverage
criterion
or
the
all-paths
criterion
,
and
the
testing
based
on
this
criterion
is
often
called
path
testing
.
The
difficulty
with
this
criterion
is
that
programs
that
contain
loops
can
have
an
infinite
number
of
possible
paths
.
Furthermore
,
not
all
paths
in
a
graph
may
be
“
fea-
sible
”
in
the
sense
that
there
may
not
be
any
inputs
for
which
the
path
can
be
executed
.
As
the
path
coverage
criterion
leads
to
a
potentially
infinite
number
of
paths
,
some
efforts
have
been
made
to
suggest
criteria
between
the
branch
coverage
and
path
coverage
.
The
basic
aim
of
these
approaches
is
to
select
a
set
of
paths
that
ensure
branch
coverage
criterion
and
try
some
other
paths
that
may
help
reveal
errors
.
One
method
to
limit
the
number
of
paths
is
to
consider
two
paths
the
same
if
they
differ
only
in
their
subpaths
that
are
caused
due
to
the
loops
.
Even
with
this
restriction
,
the
number
of
paths
can
be
extremely
large
.
It
should
be
pointed
out
that
none
of
these
criteria
is
sufficient
to
detect
all
kind
of
errors
in
programs
.
For
example
,
if
a
program
is
missing
some
control
flow
paths
that
are
needed
to
check
for
a
special
value
(
like
pointer
equals
nil
and
divisor
equals
zero
)
,
then
even
executing
all
the
paths
will
not
necessarily
detect
the
error
.
Similarly
,
if
the
set
of
paths
is
such
that
they
satisfy
the
all-
path
criterion
but
exercise
only
one
part
of
a
compound
condition
,
then
the
set
will
not
reveal
any
error
in
the
part
of
the
condition
that
is
not
exercised
.
Hence
,
even
the
path
coverage
criterion
,
which
is
the
strongest
of
the
criteria
we
have
discussed
,
is
not
strong
enough
to
guarantee
detection
of
all
the
errors
.
Once
a
coverage
criterion
is
decided
,
two
problems
have
to
be
solved
to
use
the
chosen
criterion
for
testing
.
The
first
is
to
decide
if
a
set
of
test
cases
satisfy
the
criterion
,
and
the
second
is
to
generate
a
set
of
test
cases
for
a
given
criterion
.
Deciding
whether
a
set
of
test
cases
satisfy
a
criterion
without
the
aid
of
any
tools
is
a
cumbersome
task
,
though
it
is
theoretically
possible
to
do
manually
.
For
almost
all
the
structural
testing
techniques
,
tools
are
used
to
determine
whether
the
criterion
has
been
satisfied
.
Generally
,
these
tools
will
provide
feedback
regarding
what
needs
to
be
tested
to
fully
satisfy
the
criterion
.
To
generate
the
test
cases
,
tools
are
not
that
easily
available
,
and
due
to
the
nature
of
the
problem
(
i.e.
,
undecidability
of
“
feasibility
”
of
a
path
)
,
a
fully
automated
tool
for
selecting
test
cases
to
satisfy
a
criterion
is
generally
not
possible
.
Hence
,
tools
can
,
at
best
,
aid
the
tester
.
One
method
for
generating
test
cases
is
to
randomly
select
test
data
until
the
desired
criterion
is
satisfied
(
which
is
determined
by
a
tool
)
.
This
can
result
in
a
lot
of
redundant
test
cases
,
as
many
test
cases
will
exercise
the
same
paths
.
As
test
case
generation
can
not
be
fully
automated
,
frequently
the
test
case
selection
is
done
manually
by
the
tester
by
performing
structural
testing
in
an
iterative
manner
,
starting
with
an
initial
test
case
set
and
selecting
more
test
cases
based
on
the
feedback
provided
by
the
tool
for
test
case
evaluation
.
The
test
case
evaluation
tool
can
tell
which
paths
need
to
be
executed
or
which
mutants
need
to
be
killed
.
This
information
can
be
used
to
select
further
test
cases
.
Even
with
the
aid
of
tools
,
selecting
test
cases
is
not
a
simple
process
.
Selecting
test
cases
to
execute
some
parts
of
as
yet
unexecuted
code
is
often
very
difficult
.
Because
of
this
,
and
for
other
reasons
,
the
criteria
are
often
weakened
.
For
example
,
instead
of
requiring
100
%
coverage
of
statements
and
branches
,
the
goal
might
be
to
achieve
some
acceptably
high
percentage
(
but
less
than
100
%
)
.
There
are
many
tools
available
for
statement
and
branch
coverage
,
the
crite-
ria
that
are
used
most
often
.
Both
commercial
and
freeware
tools
are
available
for
different
source
languages
.
These
tools
often
also
give
higher-level
coverage
data
like
function
coverage
,
method
coverage
,
and
class
coverage
.
To
get
the
coverage
data
,
the
execution
of
the
program
during
testing
has
to
be
closely
monitored
.
This
requires
that
the
program
be
instrumented
so
that
required
data
can
be
collected
.
A
common
method
of
instrumenting
is
to
insert
some
statements
called
probes
in
the
program
.
The
sole
purpose
of
the
probes
is
to
generate
data
about
program
execution
during
testing
that
can
be
used
to
compute
the
coverage
.
With
this
,
we
can
identify
three
phases
in
generating
coverage
data
:
Probe
insertion
can
be
done
automatically
by
a
preprocessor
.
The
execution
of
the
program
is
done
by
the
tester
.
After
testing
,
the
coverage
data
is
displayed
by
the
tool—sometimes
graphical
representations
are
also
shown
.
We
have
seen
that
during
testing
the
software
under
test
is
executed
with
a
set
of
test
cases
.
As
the
quality
of
delivered
software
depends
substantially
on
the
quality
of
testing
,
a
few
natural
questions
arise
while
testing
:
What
is
the
quality
or
reliability
of
software
after
testing
is
completed
?
During
testing
,
the
primary
purpose
of
metrics
is
to
try
to
answer
these
and
other
related
questions
.
We
will
discuss
some
metrics
that
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
.
One
of
the
most
commonly
used
approaches
for
evaluating
the
thoroughness
of
testing
is
to
use
some
coverage
measures
.
We
have
discussed
above
some
of
the
common
coverage
measures
that
are
used
in
practice—statement
coverage
and
branch
coverage
.
To
use
these
coverage
measures
for
evaluating
the
quality
of
testing
,
proper
coverage
analysis
tools
will
have
to
be
employed
which
can
inform
not
only
the
coverage
achieved
during
testing
but
also
which
portions
are
not
yet
covered
.
Often
,
organizations
build
guidelines
for
the
level
of
coverage
that
must
be
achieved
during
testing
.
Generally
,
the
coverage
requirement
will
be
higher
for
unit
testing
,
but
lower
for
system
testing
as
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
ensure
execution
of
identified
blocks
when
the
entire
system
is
being
executed
.
Often
the
coverage
requirement
at
unit
level
can
be
90
%
to
100
%
(
keep
in
mind
that
100
%
may
not
be
always
possible
as
there
may
be
unreachable
code
)
.
Besides
the
coverage
of
program
constructs
,
coverage
of
requirements
is
also
often
examined
.
It
is
for
facilitating
this
evaluation
that
in
test
case
specifica-
tion
the
requirement
or
condition
being
tested
is
mentioned
.
This
coverage
is
generally
established
by
evaluating
the
set
of
test
cases
to
ensure
that
sufficient
number
of
test
cases
with
suitable
data
are
included
for
all
the
requirements
.
The
coverage
measure
here
is
the
percentage
of
requirements
or
their
clauses/-
conditions
for
which
at
least
one
test
case
exists
.
Often
a
full
coverage
may
be
required
at
requirement
level
before
testing
is
considered
as
acceptable
.
After
testing
is
done
and
the
software
is
delivered
,
the
development
is
con-
sidered
over
.
It
will
clearly
be
desirable
to
know
,
in
quantifiable
terms
,
the
reliability
of
the
software
being
delivered
.
As
reliability
of
software
depends
considerably
on
the
quality
of
testing
,
by
assessing
reliability
we
can
also
judge
the
quality
of
testing
.
Alternatively
,
reliability
estimation
can
be
used
to
decide
whether
enough
testing
has
been
done
.
In
other
words
,
besides
characterizing
an
important
quality
property
of
the
product
being
delivered
,
reliability
esti-
mation
has
a
direct
role
in
project
management—it
can
be
used
by
the
project
manager
to
decide
whether
enough
testing
has
been
done
and
when
to
stop
testing
.
Reliability
of
a
product
specifies
the
probability
of
failure-free
operation
of
that
product
for
a
given
time
duration
.
Most
reliability
models
require
that
the
occurrence
of
failure
be
a
random
phenomenon
.
In
software
even
though
failures
occur
due
to
preexisting
bugs
,
this
assumption
will
generally
hold
for
larger
systems
,
but
may
not
hold
for
small
programs
that
have
bugs
(
in
which
case
one
might
be
able
to
predict
the
failures
)
.
Hence
,
reliability
modeling
is
more
meaningful
for
larger
systems
.
Let
X
be
the
random
variable
that
represents
the
life
of
a
system
.
Reliability
of
a
system
is
the
probability
that
the
system
has
not
failed
by
time
t.
In
other
words
,
The
reliability
of
a
system
can
also
be
specified
as
the
mean
time
to
failure
(
MTTF
)
.
MTTF
represents
the
expected
lifetime
of
the
system
.
From
the
re-
liability
function
,
it
can
be
obtained
as
[
80
]
Reliability
can
also
be
defined
in
terms
of
failure
intensity
which
is
the
failure
rate
(
i.e.
,
number
of
failures
per
unit
time
)
of
the
software
at
time
t
.
From
the
measurement
perspective
,
during
testing
,
measuring
failure
rate
is
the
easiest
,
if
defects
are
being
logged
.
A
simple
way
to
do
this
is
to
compute
the
number
of
failures
every
week
or
every
day
during
the
last
stages
of
testing
.
And
number
of
failures
can
be
approximated
by
the
number
of
defects
logged
.
(
Though
failures
and
defects
are
different
,
in
the
last
stages
of
testing
it
is
assumed
that
defects
that
cause
failures
are
fixed
soon
enough
and
therefore
do
not
cause
multiple
failures
.
)
Generally
,
this
failure
rate
increases
in
the
start
of
testing
as
more
and
more
defects
are
found
,
peaks
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
testing
,
and
then
continues
to
drop
as
fewer
defects
are
reported
.
For
a
given
test
suite
,
if
all
defects
are
fixed
,
then
there
should
be
almost
no
failures
toward
the
end
.
And
that
could
be
considered
as
proper
time
for
release
of
this
software
.
That
is
,
a
release
criterion
could
be
that
the
failure
rate
at
release
time
is
zero
failures
in
some
time
duration
,
or
zero
failures
while
executing
a
test
suite
.
Though
failure
rate
tracking
gives
a
rough
sense
of
reliability
in
terms
of
failures
per
day
or
per
week
,
for
more
accurate
reliability
estimation
,
better
models
have
to
be
used
.
Software
reliability
modeling
is
a
complex
task
,
requir-
ing
rigorous
models
and
sophisticated
statistical
analysis
.
Many
models
have
been
proposed
for
software
reliability
assessment
,
and
a
survey
of
many
of
the
models
is
given
in
[
33
,
67
]
.
It
should
be
mentioned
that
as
failure
of
software
also
depends
critically
on
the
environment
in
which
it
is
executing
,
failure
rates
experienced
in
testing
will
reflect
the
ultimate
reliability
experienced
by
the
user
after
software
release
only
if
testing
closely
mimics
the
user
behavior
.
This
may
not
be
the
case
,
particularly
with
lower
levels
of
testing
.
However
,
often
at
higher
levels
,
active
effort
is
made
to
have
the
final
test
suite
mimic
the
actual
usage
.
If
this
is
the
case
,
then
reliability
estimation
can
be
applied
with
a
higher
confidence
.
Another
analysis
of
interest
is
defect
removal
efficiency
,
though
this
can
only
be
determined
sometime
after
the
software
has
been
released
.
The
purpose
of
this
analysis
is
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
the
testing
process
being
employed
,
not
the
quality
of
testing
for
a
project
.
This
analysis
is
useful
for
improving
the
testing
process
in
the
future
.
Usually
,
after
the
software
has
been
released
to
the
client
,
the
client
will
find
defects
,
which
have
to
be
fixed
(
generally
by
the
original
developer
,
as
this
is
often
part
of
the
contract
)
.
This
defect
data
is
also
generally
logged
.
Within
a
few
months
,
most
of
the
defects
would
be
uncovered
by
the
client
(
often
the
“
warranty
”
period
is
)
.
Once
the
total
number
of
defects
(
or
a
close
approximation
to
the
total
)
is
known
,
the
defect
removal
efficiency
(
DRE
)
of
testing
can
be
computed
.
The
defect
removal
efficiency
of
a
quality
control
activity
is
defined
as
the
percentage
reduction
in
the
number
of
defects
by
executing
that
activity
[
61
]
.
As
an
example
,
suppose
the
total
number
of
defects
logged
is
500
,
out
of
which
20
were
found
after
delivery
,
and
200
were
found
during
the
system
testing
.
The
defect
removal
efficiency
of
system
testing
is
200/220
(
just
about
90
%
)
,
as
the
total
number
of
defects
present
in
the
system
when
testing
started
was
220
.
The
defect
removal
efficiency
of
the
overall
quality
process
is
480/500
,
which
is
96
%
.
Incidentally
,
this
level
of
DRE
is
decent
and
is
what
many
commercial
organizations
achieve
.
It
should
be
clear
that
DRE
is
a
general
concept
which
can
be
applied
to
any
defect
removal
activity
.
For
example
,
we
can
compute
the
DRE
of
design
review
,
or
unit
testing
.
This
can
be
done
if
for
each
defect
,
besides
logging
when
and
where
the
defect
is
found
,
the
phase
in
which
the
defect
was
introduced
is
also
analyzed
and
logged
.
With
this
information
,
when
all
the
defects
are
logged
,
the
DRE
of
the
main
quality
control
tasks
can
be
determined
.
This
information
is
extremely
useful
in
improving
the
overall
quality
process
.
Testing
is
a
dynamic
method
for
verification
and
validation
,
where
the
soft-
ware
to
be
tested
is
executed
with
carefully
designed
test
cases
and
the
behavior
of
the
software
system
is
observed
.
A
test
case
is
a
set
of
inputs
and
test
conditions
along
with
the
expected
outcome
of
testing
.
A
test
suite
is
a
set
of
test
cases
that
are
generally
executed
together
to
test
some
spe-
cific
behavior
.
During
testing
only
the
failures
of
the
system
are
observed
,
from
which
the
presence
of
faults
is
deduced
;
separate
activities
have
to
be
performed
to
identify
the
faults
and
remove
them
.
The
intent
of
testing
is
to
increase
confidence
in
the
correctness
of
the
soft-
ware
.
For
this
,
the
set
of
test
cases
used
for
testing
should
be
such
that
for
any
defect
in
the
system
,
there
is
likely
to
be
a
test
case
that
will
reveal
it
.
To
ensure
this
,
it
is
important
that
the
test
cases
are
carefully
designed
with
the
intent
of
revealing
defects
.
Due
to
the
limitations
of
the
verification
methods
for
early
phases
,
design
and
requirement
faults
also
appear
in
the
code
.
Testing
is
used
to
detect
these
errors
also
,
in
addition
to
the
errors
introduced
during
the
coding
phase
.
Hence
,
different
levels
of
testing
are
often
used
for
detecting
defects
injected
during
different
stages
.
The
commonly
employed
testing
levels
are
unit
testing
,
integration
testing
,
system
testing
,
and
acceptance
testing
.
For
testing
a
software
product
,
overall
testing
should
be
planned
,
and
for
testing
each
unit
identified
in
the
plan
,
test
cases
should
be
carefully
designed
to
reveal
errors
and
specified
in
a
document
or
a
test
script
.
There
are
two
approaches
for
designing
test
cases
:
black-box
and
white-box
.
In
black-box
testing
,
the
internal
logic
of
the
system
under
testing
is
not
con-
sidered
and
the
test
cases
are
decided
from
the
specifications
or
the
require-
ments
.
Equivalence
class
partitioning
,
boundary
value
analysis
,
and
cause-
effect
graphing
are
examples
of
methods
for
selecting
test
cases
for
black-box
testing
.
State-based
testing
is
another
approach
in
which
the
system
is
mod-
eled
as
a
state
machine
and
then
this
model
is
used
to
select
test
cases
using
some
transition
or
path-based
coverage
criteria
.
State-based
testing
can
also
be
viewed
as
gray-box
testing
in
that
it
often
requires
more
information
than
just
the
requirements
.
In
white-box
testing
,
the
test
cases
are
decided
based
on
the
internal
logic
of
the
program
being
tested
.
Often
a
criterion
is
specified
,
but
the
procedure
for
selecting
test
cases
to
satisfy
the
criteria
is
left
to
the
tester
.
The
most
common
criteria
are
statement
coverage
and
branch
coverage
.
The
main
metric
of
interest
during
testing
is
the
reliability
of
the
software
under
testing
.
If
defects
are
being
logged
,
reliability
can
be
assessed
in
terms
of
failure
rate
per
week
or
day
,
though
better
models
for
estimation
exist
.
Coverage
achieved
during
testing
,
and
defect
removal
efficiency
,
are
other
metrics
of
interest
.
Suppose
you
have
to
test
a
procedure
that
takes
two
input
parameters
,
does
some
computation
with
them
,
and
then
manipulates
a
global
table
,
the
manipulation
itself
depending
on
the
state
of
the
table
.
What
will
the
complete
specification
of
a
test
case
for
this
procedure
contain
?
What
are
the
different
levels
of
testing
and
the
goals
of
the
different
levels
?
Suppose
for
logging
defects
,
each
defect
will
be
treated
as
an
object
of
a
class
Defect
.
Give
the
definition
of
this
class
.
Suppose
a
software
has
three
inputs
,
each
having
a
defined
valid
range
.
How
many
test
cases
will
you
need
to
test
all
the
boundary
values
?
For
boundary
value
analysis
,
if
the
strategy
for
generating
test
cases
is
to
consider
all
possible
combinations
for
the
different
values
,
what
will
be
the
set
of
test
cases
for
a
software
that
has
three
inputs
X
,
Y
,
and
Z
?
Suppose
a
software
has
five
different
configuration
variables
that
are
set
indepen-
dently
.
If
three
of
them
are
binary
(
have
two
possible
values
)
,
and
the
rest
have
three
values
,
how
many
test
cases
will
be
needed
if
pairwise
testing
method
is
used
?
Consider
a
vending
machine
that
takes
quarters
and
when
it
has
received
two
quarters
,
gives
a
can
of
soda
.
Develop
a
state
model
of
this
system
,
and
then
generate
sets
of
test
cases
for
the
various
criteria
.
Consider
a
simple
text
formatter
problem
.
Given
a
text
consisting
of
words
sepa-
rated
by
blanks
(
BL
)
or
newline
(
NL
)
characters
,
the
text
formatter
has
to
covert
it
into
lines
,
so
that
no
line
has
more
than
MAXPOS
characters
,
breaks
between
lines
occur
at
BL
or
NL
,
and
the
maximum
possible
number
of
words
are
in
each
line
.
The
following
program
has
been
written
for
this
text
formatter
[

Select
a
set
of
test
cases
using
the
black-box
testing
approach
.
Use
as
many
techniques
as
possible
and
select
test
cases
for
special
cases
using
the
“
error
guessing
”
method
.
Select
a
set
of
test
cases
that
will
provide
100
%
branch
coverage
.
Suppose
that
the
last
round
of
testing
,
in
which
all
the
test
suites
were
executed
but
no
faults
were
fixed
,
took
(
2
)
.
And
in
this
testing
,
the
number
of
failures
that
were
logged
every
day
were
:
2
,
0
,
1
,
2
,
1
,
1
,
0
.
If
it
is
expected
that
an
average
user
will
use
the
software
for
two
hours
each
day
in
a
manner
that
is
similar
to
what
was
done
in
testing
,
what
is
the
expected
reliability
of
this
software
for
the
user
?
